<p class="s" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; color: rgb(31, 0, 95); font-weight: bold; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">&sect; 1</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">The complete transformation which philosophical thought in Germany has undergone in the last twenty-five years and the higher standpoint reached by spirit in its awareness of itself, have had but little influence as yet on the structure of logic.</p>

<p class="s" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; color: rgb(31, 0, 95); font-weight: bold; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">&sect; 2</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">That which, prior to this period, was called metaphysics has been, so to speak, extirpated root and branch and has vanished from the ranks of the sciences. The ontology, rational psychology, cosmology, yes even natural theology, of former times &ndash; where is now to be heard any mention of them, or who would venture to mention them? Inquiries, for instance, into the immateriality of the soul, into efficient and final causes, where should these still arouse any interest? Even the former proofs of the existence of God are cited only for their historical interest or for purposes of edification and uplifting the emotions. The fact is that there no longer exists any interest either in the form or the content of metaphysics or in both together. If it is remarkable when a nation has become indifferent to its constitutional theory, to its national sentiments, its ethical customs and virtues, it is certainly no less remarkable when a nation loses its metaphysics, when the spirit which contemplates its own pure essence is no longer a present reality in the life of the nation.</p>

<p class="s" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; color: rgb(31, 0, 95); font-weight: bold; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">&sect; 3</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">The exoteric teaching of the Kantian philosophy &mdash; that the understanding ought not to go beyond experience, else the cognitive faculty will become a theoretical reason which itself generates nothing but fantasies of the brain &mdash; this was a justification from a philosophical quarter for the renunciation of speculative thought. In support of this popular teaching came the cry of modern educationists that the needs of the time demanded attention to immediate requirements, that just as experience was the primary factor for knowledge, so for skill in public and private life, practice and practical training generally were essential and alone necessary, theoretical insight being harmful even. Philosophy [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Wissenschaft</em>] and ordinary common sense thus co-operating to bring about the downfall of metaphysics, there was seen the strange spectacle of a cultured nation without metaphysics &ndash; like a temple richly ornamented in other respects but without a holy of holies. Theology, which in former times was the guardian of&nbsp;<a name="HL1_26n"></a>the speculative mysteries and of metaphysics (although this was subordinate to it) had given up this science in exchange for feelings, for what was popularly matter-of-fact, and for historical erudition. In keeping with this change, there vanished from the world those solitary souls who were sacrificed by their people and exiled from the world to the end that the eternal should be contemplated and served by lives devoted solely thereto &mdash; not for any practical gain but for the sake of blessedness; a disappearance which, in another context, can be regarded as essentially the same phenomenon as that previously mentioned. So that having got rid of the dark utterances of metaphysics, of the colourless communion of the spirit with itself, outer existence seemed to be transformed into the bright world of flowers &ndash; and there are no&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">black&nbsp;</em>flowers, as we know.</p>

<p class="s" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; color: rgb(31, 0, 95); font-weight: bold; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">&sect; 4</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;"><a name="HL1_26"></a><a name="HL1_26a"></a>Logic did not fare quite so badly as metaphysics.&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">That one&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">learns</em>&nbsp;from logic&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">how to think</em>&nbsp;(the usefulness of logic and hence its purpose, were held to consist in this &mdash; just as if one could only learn how to digest and move about by studying anatomy and physiology)</span>&nbsp;this prejudice has long since vanished, and the spirit of practicality certainly did not intend for logic a better fate than was suffered by the sister science.</p>

<p class="s" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; color: rgb(31, 0, 95); font-weight: bold; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">&sect; 5</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, probably for the sake of a certain formal utility, it was still left a place among the sciences, and indeed was even retained as a subject of public instruction. However, this better lot concerns only the outer fate of logic, for its structure and contents have remained the same throughout a long inherited tradition, although in the course of being passed on the contents have become ever more diluted and attenuated; logic shows no traces so far of the new spirit which has arisen in the sciences no less than in the world of actuality. However, once the substantial form of the spirit has inwardly reconstituted itself, all attempts to preserve the forms of an earlier culture are utterly in vain; like withered leaves they are pushed off by the new buds already growing at their roots.</p>

<p class="s" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; color: rgb(31, 0, 95); font-weight: bold; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">&sect; 6</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">Even in the philosophical sphere this ignoring of the general change is beginning gradually to come to an end. Imperceptibly, even those who are opposed to the new ideas have become familiar with them and have appropriated them, and if they continue to speak slightingly of the source and principles of those ideas and to dispute them, still they have accepted their consequences and have been unable to defend themselves from their influence; the only way in which they can give a positive significance and a content to their negative attitude which is becoming less and less important, is to fall in with the new ways of thinking.</p>

<p class="s" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; color: rgb(31, 0, 95); font-weight: bold; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">&sect; 7</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">On the other hand, it seems that the period of fermentation with which a new creative idea begins is past. In its first manifestation, such an idea usually displays a fanatical hostility toward the entrenched systematisation of the older principle; usually too, it is fearful of losing itself in the ramifications of the particular and again it shuns the labour required for a scientific elaboration of the new principle and in its need for such, it grasps to begin with at an empty formalism. The challenge to elaborate and systematise the material now becomes all the more pressing. There is a period in the culture of an epoch as in the culture of the individual, when the primary concern is the acquisition and assertion of the principle in its undeveloped intensity. But the higher demand is that it should become systematised knowledge.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;"><a name="HL1_27"></a>Now whatever may have been accomplished for the form and content of philosophy in other directions, the&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">science of logic which constitutes metaphysics proper or purely speculative philosophy</span>, has hitherto still been much neglected. What it is exactly that I understand by this science and its standpoint, I have stated provisionally in the Introduction.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">The fact that it has been necessary to make a completely fresh start with this science, the very nature of the subject matter and the absence of any previous works which might have been utilised for the projected reconstruction of logic, may be taken into account by fair-minded critics, even though a labour covering many years has been unable to give this effort a greater perfection. The essential point of view is that what is involved is an altogether new concept of scientific procedure.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;"><a name="HL1_27a"></a><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">Philosophy</span>, if it would be a science,&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">cannot</span>, as I have remarked elsewhere,&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">borrow its method from a subordinate science like mathematics</span>, any more than it can remain satisfied with categorical assurances of inner intuition, or employ arguments based on grounds adduced by external reflection.&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">On the contrary, it can be only the nature of the content itself which spontaneously develops itself in a scientific method of knowing, since it is at the same time the reflection of the content itself which first posits and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">generates</em>&nbsp;its determinate character</span>.</p>

<p class="s" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; color: rgb(31, 0, 95); font-weight: bold; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">&sect; 9</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;"><a name="HL1_28"></a><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">The understanding&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determines</em>, and holds the determinations fixed; reason is negative and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dialectical</em>, because it resolves the determinations of the understanding into nothing;&nbsp;</span>it is positive because it generates the universal and comprehends the particular therein.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">Just as the understanding is usually taken to be something separate from reason as such, so too dialectical reason is usually taken to be something distinct from positive reason. But reason in its truth is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">spirit&nbsp;</em>which is higher than either merely positive reason, or merely intuitive understanding.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">It is the negative, that which constitutes the quality alike of dialectical reason and of understanding; it&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">negates what is simple</span>, thus positing the specific difference of the understanding; it equally resolves it and is thus dialectical.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">But it does not stay in the nothing of this result but in the result is no less positive, and in this way it has restored what was at first simple, but as a universal which is within itself concrete; a given particular is not subsumed under this universal but in this determining, this positing of a difference, and the resolving of it, the particular has at the same time already determined itself. This spiritual movement which, in its simple undifferentiatedness, gives itself its own determinateness and in its determinateness its equality with itself, which therefore is the immanent development of the Notion, this movement is the absolute method of knowing and at the same time is the immanent soul of the content itself.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;"><a name="HL1_28aa"></a>I maintain that&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">it is this self-construing method alone which enables philosophy to be an objective, demonstrated science</span>.</p>

Consciousness is spirit as a concrete knowing, a knowing too, in which externality is involved;&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">but the development of this object,&nbsp;<a name="HL1_28a"></a>like the development of all natural and spiritual life, rests solely on the nature of the pure essentialities which constitute the content of logic</span>.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">Consciousness, as spirit in its manifestation which in its progress frees itself from its immediacy and external concretion, attains to the pure knowing which takes as its object those same pure essentialities as they are in and for themselves. They are pure thoughts, spirit thinking its own essential nature. Their self-movement is their spiritual life and is that through which philosophy constitutes itself and of which it is the exposition.</p>

<p class="s" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; color: rgb(31, 0, 95); font-weight: bold; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">&sect; 11</p>

As regards the external relation, it was intended that the first part of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">System of Science&nbsp;</em>which contains the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Phenomenology&nbsp;</em>should be followed by a second part containing logic and the two concrete [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">realen</em>] sciences, the Philosophy of Nature and the Philosophy of Spirit, which would complete the System of Philosophy. But the necessary expansion which logic itself has demanded has induced me to have this part published separately; it thus forms the first sequel to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Phenomenology of Spirit&nbsp;</em>in an expanded arrangement of the system. It will later be followed by an exposition of the two concrete philosophical sciences mentioned. This first volume of the Logic contains as Book One the Doctrine of Being; Book Two, the Doctrine of Essence, which forms the second part of the first volume, is already in the press; the second volume will contain Subjective Logic or the Doctrine of the Notion.</p>

One title to such claim in the first instance may well be based on the fact that in the main there was available for the contents of the science only external material in the older metaphysics and logic. Though these two sciences have been universally and abundantly cultivated, the latter even up to our own day, the interest taken in the speculative side has been only slight; in fact, on the whole, the same material has been just repeated over and over again, sometimes being thinned out to the point of being trivial and superficial and sometimes more of the old ballast has been hauled out afresh and trailed along with logic. From such efforts, often purely mechanical, the philosophical import of the science could gain nothing.</p>

Into all that becomes something inward for men, an image or conception as such, into all that he makes his own, language has penetrated, and everything that he has transformed into language and expresses in it contains a category &ndash; concealed, mixed with other forms or clearly determined as such, so much is Logic his natural element, indeed his own peculiar&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nature</em>. If nature as such, as the physical world, is contrasted with the&nbsp;<a name="HL1_32n"></a>spiritual sphere, then logic must certainly be said to be the supernatural element which permeates every relationship of man to nature, his sensation, intuition, desire, need, instinct, and simply by so doing transforms it into something human, even though only formally human, into ideas and purposes. It is an advantage when a language possesses an abundance of logical expressions, that is, specific and separate expressions for the thought determinations themselves; many prepositions and articles denote relationships based on thought; the Chinese language is supposed not to have developed to this stage or only to an inadequate extent. These particles, however, play quite a subordinate part having only a slightly more independent form than the prefixes and suffixes, inflections and the like. It is much more important that in a language the categories should appear in the form of substantives and verbs and thus be stamped with the form of objectivity. In this respect German has many advantages over other modern languages; some of its words even possess the further peculiarity of having not only different but opposite meanings so that one cannot fail to recognise a speculative spirit of the language in them: it can delight a thinker to come across such words and to find the union of opposites naively shown in the dictionary as one word with opposite meanings, although this result of speculative thinking is nonsensical to the understanding. Philosophy therefore stands in no need of a special terminology; true, some words have to be taken from foreign languages but these have already acquired through usage the right of citizenship in the philosophical realm &ndash; and an affected purism would be most inappropriate where it was the distinctive meaning which was of decisive importance. The advance of culture generally, and of the sciences in particular, gradually brings into use higher relationships of thought, or at least raises them to greater universality and they have thus attracted increased attention. This applies even to the empirical and natural sciences which in general employ the commonest categories, for example, whole and parts, a thing and its properties, and the like.</p>

The simple basic determination or common form of the collection of such forms is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identity&nbsp;</em>which, in the logic of this collection, is asserted as the law of identity, as A = A, and as the principle of contradiction. Healthy common sense has so much lost its respect for the school which claims possession of such laws of truth and still busies itself with them that it ridicules it and its laws and regards anyone as insufferable who can utter truths in accordance with such laws: the plant is &mdash; a plant, science is &mdash; science. It has also formed an equally just estimate of the significance of the formulas which constitute the rules of syllogising which in fact is a cardinal function of the understanding (although it would be a mistake not to recognise that these have their place in cognition where they must be obeyed); it knows that the formulas quite as well serve impartially error and sophistry and that however truth may be defined, they cannot serve higher, for example, religious truth &mdash; that generally speaking they concern only the correctness of the knowledge of facts, not truth itself.</p>

It is soon evident that what at first to ordinary reflection is, as content, divorced from form, cannot in fact be formless, cannot be devoid of inner determination; if it were, then it would be only vacuity, the abstraction of the thing-in-itself; that, on the contrary, the content in its own self possesses form, in fact it is through form alone that it has soul and meaning, and that it is form itself which is transformed only into the semblance of a content, hence into the semblance of something external to this semblance. With this introduction of the content into the logical treatment, the subject matter is not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">things&nbsp;</em>but their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">import,&nbsp;</em>the Notion of them. But in this connection we can be reminded that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">there is</em>a multitude of Notions, a multitude of objects [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Sache</em>]. We have, however, already said how it is that restrictions are imposed on this multitude, that the Notion, simply as thought, as a universal, is the immeasurable abbreviation of the multitudes of particular things which are vaguely present to intuition and pictorial thought; but also a Notion is, first, in its own self&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the&nbsp;</em>Notion, and this is only one and is the substantial foundation; secondly, a Notion is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>and it is this determinateness in it which appears as content: but the determinateness of the Notion is a specific form of this substantial oneness, a moment of the form as totality,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of that same Notion</em>which is the foundation of the specific Notions.</p>

When those determinations of thought which are only external forms are truly considered in themselves, this can only result in demonstrating their finitude and the untruth of their supposed independent self-subsistence, that their truth is the Notion. Consequently, the science of logic in dealing with the thought determinations which in general run through our mind instinctively and unconsciously &mdash; and even when they become part of the language do not become objects of our attention &mdash; will also be a reconstruction of those which are singled out by reflection and are fixed by it as subjective forms external to the matter and import of the determinations of thought.</p>

Such an exposition would demand that at no stage of the development should any thought-determination or reflection occur which does not immediately emerge at this stage and that has not entered this stage from the one preceding it &mdash; a requirement which is satisfied, after its fashion, in the process of mathematical reasoning. However, such an abstract perfection of exposition must, I admit, in general be dispensed with; the very fact that the science must begin with what is absolutely simple, that is, with what is most general and of least import, would restrict the exposition solely to these same quite simple expressions of the simple without any further addition of a single word; all that could properly be admitted would be negative considerations intended to ward off and banish any heterogeneous elements which otherwise might be introduced by pictorial thought or unregulated thinking. However, such intrusive elements in the simple immanent course of the development are themselves contingent, so that the effort to ward them off is itself tainted with this contingency; besides which it is futile to try to deal with all of them, lying as they do outside the subject matter, and in any case, any demand for a systematic disposal of such random reflections could only be partially satisfied. But the peculiar restlessness and distraction of our modern consciousness compel us to take some account of the more readily suggested reflections and opinions. A plastic discourse demands, too, a plastic receptivity and understanding on the part of the listener; but youths and men of such a temper who would calmly suppress&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">their own&nbsp;</em>reflections and opinions in which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">original&nbsp;</em>thought is so impatient to manifest itself, listeners such as Plato feigned, who would attend only to the matter in hand, could have no place in a modern dialogue; still less could one count on readers of such a disposition. On the contrary, I have been only too often and too vehemently attacked by opponents who were incapable of making the simple reflection that their opinions and objections contain categories which are presuppositions and which themselves need to be criticised first before they are employed. Ignorance in this matter reaches incredible lengths; it is guilty of, the fundamental misunderstanding, the uncouth and uneducated behaviour of taking a category which is under consideration for&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something other&nbsp;</em>than the category itself. This ignorance is the less justifiable because this &#39;something other&#39; consists of determinate thoughts and concepts, and in a system of logic these other categories must likewise have been assigned their own place and must themselves have been subjected to critical examination within the system. This ignorance is most obvious in the great majority of the objections and attacks on the first Notions of logic, being and nothing, and becoming which, itself a simple determination &mdash; the simplest analysis shows it to be so &mdash; contains the two other determinations as moments. Thoroughness seems to require that the beginning, as the foundation on which everything is built, should be examined before anything else, in fact that we should not go any further until it has been firmly established and if, on the other hand, it is not, that we should reject all that follows.</p>

Such presuppositions as that infinite is different from finitude, that content is other than form, that the inner is other than the outer, also that mediation is no immediacy (as if anyone did not know such things), are brought forward by way of information and narrated and asserted rather than proved. But there is something stupid &mdash; I can find no other word for it &mdash; about this didactic behaviour; technically it is unjustifiable simply to presuppose and straightway assume such propositions; and, still more, it reveals ignorance of the fact that it is the requirement and the business of logical thinking to enquire into just this, whether such a finite without infinity is something true, or whether such an abstract infinity, also a content without form and a form without content, an inner by itself which has no outer expression, an externality without an inwardness, whether any of these is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something true</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something actual.&nbsp;</em>But this education and discipline of thinking by which it acquires plasticity and by which the impatience of casual reflection is overcome, is procured solely by going further, by study and by carrying out to its conclusion the entire development.</p>

In every other science the subject matter and the scientific method are distinguished from each other; also the content does not make an absolute beginning but is dependent on other concepts and is connected on all sides with other material. These other sciences are, therefore, permitted to speak of their ground and its context and also of their method, only as premises taken for granted which, as forms of definitions and such-like presupposed as familiar and accepted, are to be applied straight-way, and also to employ the usual kind of reasoning for the establishment of their general concepts and fundamental determinations.</p>

But not only the account of scientific method, but even the Notion itself of the science as such belongs to its content, and in fact constitutes its final result; what logic is cannot be stated beforehand, rather does this knowledge of what it is first emerge as the final outcome and consummation of the whole exposition. Similarly, it is essentially within the science that the subject matter of logic, namely, thinking or more specifically&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comprehensive</em>&nbsp;thinking is considered; the Notion of logic has its genesis in the course of exposition and cannot therefore be premised. Consequently, what is premised in this Introduction is not intended, as it were, to establish the Notion of Logic or to justify its method scientifically in advance, but rather by the aid of some reasoned and historical explanations and reflections to make more accessible to ordinary thinking the point of view from which this science is to be considered.</p>

First, it is assumed that the material of knowing is present on its own account as a ready-made world apart from thought, that thinking on its own is empty and comes as an external form to the said material, fills itself with it and only thus acquires a content and so becomes real knowing.</p>

Truth is the agreement of thought with the object, and in order to bring about this agreement &mdash; for it does not exist on its own account &mdash; thinking is supposed to adapt and accommodate itself to the object.</p>

Thinking therefore in its reception and formation of material does not go outside itself; its reception of the material and the conforming of itself to it remains a modification of its own self, it does not result in thought becoming the other of itself; and self-conscious determining moreover belongs only to thinking. In its relation to the object, therefore, thinking does not go out of itself to the object; this, as a thing-in-itself, remains a sheer beyond of thought.</p>

For it based itself on the fact that the knowledge of things obtained through thinking is alone what is really true in them, that is, things not in their immediacy but as first raised into the form of thought, as things&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thought.&nbsp;</em>Thus this metaphysics believed that thinking (and its determinations) is not anything alien to the object, but rather is its essential nature, or that things and the thinking of them &mdash; our language too expresses their kinship &mdash; are explicitly in full agreement, thinking in its immanent determinations and the true nature of things forming one and the same content.</p>

We must know exactly what is meant by this expression which moreover is often used as a slogan; in general it stands for the understanding as abstracting, and hence as separating and remaining fixed in its separations. Directed against reason, it behaves as ordinary common sense and imposes its view that truth rests on sensuous reality, that thoughts are only thoughts, meaning that it is sense perception which first gives them filling and reality and that reason left to its own resources engenders only figments of the brain. In this self-renunciation on the part of reason, the Notion of truth is lost; it is limited to knowing only subjective truth, only phenomena, appearances, only something to which the nature of the object itself does not correspond: knowing has lapsed into opinion.</p>

The basis of that universally held conception is, namely, to be sought in the insight into the necessary conflict of the determinations of the understanding with themselves. The reflection already referred to is this, to transcend the concrete immediate object and to determine it and separate it. But&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equally</em>&nbsp;it must transcend these its<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">separating&nbsp;</em>determinations and straightway&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">connect&nbsp;</em>them. It is at the stage of this connecting of the determinations that their conflict emerges. This connecting activity of reflection belongs in itself to reason and the rising above those determinations which attains to an insight into their conflict is the great negative step towards the true Notion of reason. But the insight, when not thorough-going, commits the mistake of thinking that it is reason which is in contradiction with itself; it does not recognise that the contradiction is precisely the rising of reason above the limitations of the understanding and the resolving of them, Cognition, instead of taking from this stage the final step into the heights, has fled from the unsatisfactoriness of the categories of the understanding to sensuous existence, imagining that in this it possesses what is solid and self-consistent. But on the other hand, since this knowledge is self-confessedly knowledge only of appearances, the unsatisfactoriness of the latter is admitted, but at the same time presupposed: as much as to say that admittedly, we have no proper knowledge of things-in-themselves but we do have a proper knowledge of them within the sphere of appearances, as if, so to speak, only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">kind of objects&nbsp;</em>were different, and one kind, namely things-in-themselves, did not fall within the scope of our knowledge but the other kind, phenomena, did. This is like attributing to someone a correct perception, with the rider that nevertheless he is incapable of perceiving what is true but only what is false. Absurd as this would be, it would not be more so than a true knowledge which did not know the object as it is in itself.</p>

This can have no other meaning than that these forms are in themselves something untrue. But then if they are allowed to remain valid for subjective reason and experience, the criticism has not produced any alteration in them: they are left in the same shape for the subject knower as they formerly possessed for the object. If, however, they are inadequate for the thing-in-itself, still less must the understanding to which they are supposed to belong put up with them and rest content with them. If they cannot be determinations of the thing-in-itself, still less can they be determinations of the understanding to which one ought at least to concede the dignity of a thing-in-itself. The determinations of finite and infinite conflict in the same way, whether they are applied to time and space, to the world, or are determinations within the mind &mdash; just as black and white produce grey whether they are mixed on a canvas or on the palette. If our conception of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">world&nbsp;</em>is dissolved by the transference to it of the determinations of infinite and finite, still more is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">spirit</em>itself, which contains both of them, inwardly self-contradictory and self-dissolving: it is not the nature of the material or the object to which they are applied or in which they occur that can make a difference for it is only through those determinations and in accordance with them that the object contains the contradiction.</p>

That is to say, this criticism did not consider these forms on their own merits and according to their own peculiar content, but simply took them as accepted starting points from subjective logic: so that there was no question of an immanent deduction of them as forms of subjective logic, still less of a dialectical consideration of them.</p>

But it is not for this reason a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">formal</em>&nbsp;science lacking significant truth. Moreover, the region of truth is not to be sought in that matter which is missing in logic, a deficiency to which the unsatisfactoriness of the science is usually attributed. The truth is rather that the insubstantial nature of logical forms originates solely in the way in which they are considered and dealt with. When they are taken as fixed determinations and consequently in their separation from each other and not as held together in an organic unity, then they are dead forms and the spirit which is their&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">living, concrete unity</span>&nbsp;does not dwell in them. As thus taken, they lack a substantial content &mdash; a matter which would be substantial in itself. The content which is missing in the logical forms is nothing else than a solid foundation and a concretion of these abstract determinations; and such a substantial being for them is usually sought outside them.</p>

One need not therefore look far for what is commonly called a matter; if logic is supposed to lack a substantial content, then the fault does not lie with its subject matter but solely with the way in which this subject matter is grasped.</p>

Such tangibility is, for example, imported even into the Platonic Ideas which are in God&#39;s thinking, as if they are, as it were, existing things but in another world or region; while the world of actuality exists outside that region and has a substantial existence distinct from those Ideas and only through this distinction is a substantial reality. The Platonic Idea is the universal, or more definitely the Notion of an object; only in its Notion does something possess actuality and to the extent that it is distinct from its Notion it ceases to be actual and is a non-entity; the side of tangibility and sensuous self-externality belongs to this null aspect. But on the other side, one can appeal to the conceptions of ordinary logic itself; for it is assumed, for example, that the determinations contained in definitions do not belong only to the knower, but are determinations of the object, constituting its innermost essence and its very own nature. Or, if from given determinations others are inferred, it is assumed that what is inferred is not something external and alien to the object, but rather that it belongs to the object itself, that to the thought there is a correspondent being.</p>

But the liberation from the opposition of consciousness which the science of logic must be able to presuppose lifts the determinations of thought above this timid, incomplete standpoint and demands that they be considered not with any such limitation and reference but as they are in their own proper character, as logic, as pure reason.</p>

Now if logic has not undergone any change since Aristotle &mdash; and in fact, judging by modern compendiums of logic the changes frequently consist mainly in omissions &mdash; then surely the conclusion which should be drawn is that it is all the more in need of a total reconstruction; for spirit, after its labours over two thousand years, must have attained to a higher consciousness about its thinking and about its own pure, essential nature.</p>

Its determinations are accepted in their unmoved fixity and are brought only into external relation with each other. In judgments and syllogisms the operations are in the main reduced to and founded on the quantitative aspect of the determinations; consequently everything rests on an external difference, on mere comparison and becomes a completely analytical procedure and mechanical calculation. The deduction of the so-called rules and laws, chiefly of inference, is not much better than a manipulation of rods of unequal length in order to sort and group them according to size &mdash; than&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">a childish game of fitting together the pieces of a coloured picture puzzle</span>.</p>

In arithmetic, numbers are regarded as devoid of any concrete conceptual content, so apart from their wholly external relationship they have no meaning, and neither in themselves nor in their interrelationships are thoughts. When it is calculated in mechanical fashion that three-fourths multiplied by two-thirds makes one-half, this operation contains about as much and as little thought as calculating whether in a logical figure this or that kind of syllogism is valid.</p>

In the present state of logic one can scarcely recognise even a trace of scientific method. It has roughly the form of an empirical science. The empirical sciences have found for their own appropriate purposes their own peculiar method, such as it is, of defining and classifying their material. Pure mathematics, too, has its method which is appropriate for its abstract objects and for the quantitative form in which alone it considers them. I have said what is essential in the preface to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Phenomenology of Spirit</em>&nbsp;about this method and, in general, the subordinate form of scientific method which can be employed in mathematics; but it will also be considered in more detail in the logic itself. Spinoza, Wolff and others have let themselves be misled in applying it also to philosophy and in making the external course followed by Notion-less quantity, the course of the Notion, a procedure which is absolutely contradictory.</p>

Because the result, the negation, is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific</em>negation, it has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content</em>. It is a fresh Notion but higher and richer than its predecessor; for it is richer by the negation or opposite of the latter, therefore contains it, but also something more, and is the unity of itself and its opposite. It is in this way that the system of Notions as such has to be formed &mdash; and has to complete itself in a purely continuous course in which nothing extraneous is introduced.</p>

Even in logic, for example, we may be told perhaps that &#39;logic has two main parts, the theory of elements and methodology&#39;, then under the former there straightway follows perhaps the superscription,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Laws of Thought</em>; and then,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Chapter I: Concepts. First Section: Of the Clearness of Concepts</em>, and so on. These definitions and divisions, made without any deduction or justification, constitute the systematic framework and the entire connectedness of such sciences. Such a logic regards it as its vocation to talk about the necessity of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">deducing</em>&nbsp;concepts and truths from principles; but as regards what it calls method, the thought of a deduction of it simply does not occur to it. The procedure consists, perhaps, in grouping together what is similar and making what is simple precede what is complex, and other external considerations.</p>

Because dialectic was held to be merely the art of practising deceptions and producing illusions, the assumption was made forthwith that it is only a spurious game, the whole of its power resting solely on concealment of the deceit and that its results are obtained only surreptitiously and are a subjective illusion. True, Kant&#39;s expositions in the antinomies of pure reason, when closely examined as they will be at length in the course of this work, do not indeed deserve any great praise; but the general idea on which he based his expositions and which he vindicated, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objectivity of the illusion</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessity of the contradiction</em>&nbsp;which belongs to the nature of thought determinations: primarily, it is true, with the significance that these determinations are applied by reason to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">things in themselves</em>; but their nature is precisely what they are in reason and with reference to what is intrinsic or in itself.</p>

An exposition of logic to this end would, in its method, have to keep to the division of the subject above-mentioned and with regard to the more detailed contents, to the definitions given for the particular Notions without touching on the dialectical aspect. As regards its external structure, such an exposition would resemble the usual presentation of this science, but it would also be distinguished from it with respect to the content and still would serve for practice in abstract thinking, though not in speculative thinking, a purpose which can never be realised by the logic which has become popular through the addition of psychological and anthropological material. It would give to mind the picture of a methodically ordered whole, although the soul of the structure, the method (which dwells in the dialectical aspect) would not itself appear in it.</p>

It is one thing for him who comes to it and the sciences generally for the first time, but it is another thing for him who comes back to it from these sciences</span>. He who begins the study of grammar finds in its forms and laws dry abstractions, arbitrary rules, in general an isolated collection of definitions and terms which exhibit only the value and significance of what is implied in their immediate meaning; there is nothing to be known in them other than themselves. On the other hand, he who has mastered a language and at the same time has a comparative knowledge of other languages, he alone can make contact with the spirit and culture of a people through the grammar of its language; the same rules and forms now have a substantial, living value. Similarly, he who approaches this science at first finds in logic an isolated system of abstractions which, confined within itself, does not embrace within its scope the other knowledges and sciences.&nbsp;</p>

The first acquaintance with logic confines its significance to itself alone; its content passes only for a detached occupation with the determinations of thought,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alongside</em>&nbsp;which other scientific activities possess on their own account a matter and content of their own, on which logic may perhaps have a formal influence, though an influence which comes only from itself and which if necessary can of course also be dispensed with so far as the scientific structure and its study are concerned.</p>

This however has vanished; the said unity remains the element, and the distinctions of the division and of the development no longer originate outside that element. Consequently the earlier determinations (those used on the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pathway to truth</em>) such as subjectivity and objectivity, or even thought and being, or Notion and reality, no matter from what standpoint they were determined, have lost their independent and purely affirmative character and&nbsp;<a name="HL1_61"></a>are now&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in their truth,</em>that is, in their unity, reduced to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">forms.&nbsp;</em>In their difference, therefore, they themselves remain&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly</em>&nbsp;the whole Notion, and this, in the division, is posited only under its own specifications.</p>

The reason too why reference must often be made to it in the objective logic is that it enters into detailed consideration of important,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more specific</em>&nbsp;aspects of logic, whereas later philosophical works have paid little attention to these and in some instances have only displayed a crude &mdash; not unavenged &mdash; contempt for them. The philosophising which is most widespread among us does&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not</em>&nbsp;go beyond the Kantian results, that Reason cannot acquire knowledge of any true content or subject matter and in regard to absolute truth must be directed to faith. But what with Kant is a result, forms the immediate starting-point in this philosophising, so that the preceding exposition from which that result issued and which is a philosophical cognition, is cut away beforehand. The Kantian philosophy thus serves as a cushion for intellectual indolence which soothes itself with the conviction that everything is already proved and settled. Consequently for genuine knowledge, for a specific content of thought which is not to be found in such barren and arid complacency, one must turn to that preceding exposition.</p>

Such an object is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thought,</em>and to determine it means partly, first to produce it, partly, in so far as it is something presupposed, to have further thoughts about it, to develop it further by thought.</p>

Hence this philosophy has not contributed in the slightest to a knowledge of their nature; what alone is of interest in this connection occurs in the Critique of Ideas. But if philosophy was to make any real progress, it was necessary that the interest of thought should be drawn to a consideration of the formal side, to a consideration of the ego, of consciousness as such, i.e. of the abstract relation of a subjective knowing to an object, so that in this way the cognition of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite form,&nbsp;</em>that is, of the Notion, would be introduced. But in order that this cognition may be reached, that form has still to be relieved of the finite determinateness in which it is ego, or consciousness. The form, when thus thought out into its purity, will have within itself the capacity to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determine&nbsp;</em>itself, that is, to give itself a content, and that a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessarily&nbsp;</em>explicated content in the form of a system of determinations of thought.</p>

But further, objective logic also comprises the rest of metaphysics in so far as this attempted to comprehend with the forms of pure thought particular substrata taken primarily from figurate conception, namely the soul, the world and God; and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinations of thought</em>constituted what was&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential&nbsp;</em>in the mode of consideration.

The beginning as such, on the other hand, as something subjective in the sense of being a particular, inessential way of introducing the discourse, remains unconsidered, a matter of indifference, and so too the need to find an answer to the question, With what should the beginning be made? remains of no importance in face of the need for a principle in which alone the interest of the matter in hand seems to lie, the interest as to what is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">truth, the absolute ground.</em></p>

If earlier abstract thought was interested in the principle only as content, but in the course of philosophical development has been impelled to pay attention to the other side, to the behaviour of the cognitive process, this implies that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the subjective&nbsp;</em>act has also been grasped as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential&nbsp;</em>moment of objective truth, and this brings with it the need to unite the method with the content, the form with the principle. Thus the principle ought also to be the beginning, and what is the first for thought ought also to be the first in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">process</em>&nbsp;of thinking.</p>

In so far as this can be dealt with<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">preliminarily&nbsp;</em>it has been done elsewhere. Here we need only quote from it this,&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">there is nothing, nothing in heaven, or in nature or in mind or anywhere else which does not equally contain both immediacy and mediation</span>, so that these two determinations reveal themselves to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unseparated</em>&nbsp;and inseparable and the opposition between them to be a nullity. But as regards the philosophical discussion of this, it is to be found in every logical proposition in which occur the determinations of immediacy and mediation and consequently also the discussion of their opposition and their truth. Inasmuch as this opposition, as related to thinking, to knowing, to cognition, acquires the more concrete form of immediate or mediated&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">knowledge</em>, it is the nature of cognition as such which is considered within the science of logic, while the more concrete form of cognition falls to be considered in the philosophy of spirit. But to want the nature of cognition clarified&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">prior</em>&nbsp;to the science is to demand that it be considered&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside</em>&nbsp;the science;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside</em>&nbsp;the science this cannot be accomplished, at least not in a scientific manner and such a manner is alone here in place.&nbsp;</p>

Logic, then, has for its presupposition the science of manifested spirit, which contains and demonstrates the necessity, and so the truth, of the standpoint occupied by pure&nbsp;<a name="HL1_69"></a>knowing and of its mediation. In this science of manifested spirit the beginning is made from empirical,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sensuous&nbsp;</em>consciousness and this is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>knowledge in the strict sense of the word; in that work there is discussed the significance of this immediate knowledge. Other forms of consciousness such as belief in divine truths, inner experience, knowledge through inner revelation, etc., are very ill-fitted to be quoted as examples of immediate knowledge as a little reflection will show. In the work just mentioned immediate consciousness is also the first and that which is immediate in the science itself, and therefore the presupposition; but in logic, the presupposition is that which has proved itself to be the result of that phenomenological consideration &mdash; the Idea as pure knowledge.</p>

Thus consciousness on its onward path from the immediacy with which it began is led back to absolute knowledge as its innermost truth. This last, the ground, is then also that from which the first proceeds, that which at first appeared as an immediacy. This is true in still greater measure of absolute spirit which reveals itself as the concrete and final supreme truth of all being, and which at the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">end&nbsp;</em>of the development is known as freely externalising itself, abandoning itself to the shape of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>being &mdash;opening or unfolding itself [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sich entschliessend</em>] into the creation of a world which contains all that fell into the development which preceded that result and which through this reversal of its position relatively to its beginning is transformed into something dependent on the result as principle. The essential requirement for the science of logic is not so much that the beginning be a pure immediacy, but rather that the whole of the science be within itself a circle in which the first is also the last and the last is also the first.</p>

Further, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">progress&nbsp;</em>from that which forms the beginning is to be regarded as only a further determination of it, hence that which forms the starting point of the development remains at the base of all that follows and does not vanish from it.

It is when taken in this way that this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pure being,&nbsp;</em>this absolute immediacy has equally the character of something absolutely mediated. But it is equally essential that it be taken only in the one-sided character in which it is pure immediacy,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">precisely because&nbsp;</em>here it is the beginning. If it were not this pure indeterminateness, if it were determinate, it would have been taken as something mediated, something already carried a stage further: what is determinate implies an other to a first. Therefore, it lies in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">very nature of a beginning&nbsp;</em>that it must be being and nothing else.

This concept could be regarded as the first, purest, that is, most abstract definition of the absolute &mdash; as it would in fact be if we were at all concerned with the form of definitions and with the name of the absolute. In this sense, that abstract concept would be the first definition of this absolute and all further determinations and developments only more specific and richer definitions of it. But let those who are dissatisfied with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>as a beginning because it passes over into nothing and so gives rise to the unity of being and nothing, let them see whether they find this beginning which begins with the general idea of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beginning&nbsp;</em>and with its analysis (which, though of course correct, likewise leads to the unity of being and nothing), more satisfactory than the beginning with being.</p>

The said analysis presupposes as familiar the idea of a beginning, thus following the example of other sciences. These presuppose their subject-matter and take it for granted that everyone has roughly the same general idea of it and can find in it the same determinations as those indicated by the sciences which have obtained them in one way or another through analysis, comparison and other kinds of reasoning. But that which forms the absolute beginning must likewise be something otherwise known; now if it is something concrete and hence is variously determined within itself, then this<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">internal relation&nbsp;</em>is presupposed as something known; it is thus put forward as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediacy&nbsp;</em>which, however, it is not; for it is a relation only as a relation of distinct moments, and it therefore contains&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediation&nbsp;</em>within itself. Further, with a concrete object, the analysis and the ways in which it is determined are affected by contingency and arbitrariness. Which determinations are brought out depends on what each person just&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finds&nbsp;</em>in&nbsp;<a name="HL1_75"></a>his own immediate, contingent idea. The relation contained in something concrete, in a synthetic unity, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessary&nbsp;</em>only in so far as it is not just given but is produced by the spontaneous return of the moments back into this unity &mdash; a movement which is the opposite of the analytical procedure, which is an activity belonging to the subject-thinker and external to the subject matter itself.</p>

For the ego, this immediate consciousness of self, at first appears to be itself both an immediacy and also something much more familiar to us than any other idea; anything else known belongs to the ego, it is true, but is still a content distinguished from it and therefore contingent; the ego, on the contrary, is the simple certainty of its own self.</p>

Before the ego, this concrete Being, can be made the beginning and ground of philosophy, it must be disrupted &mdash; this is the absolute act through which the ego purges itself of its content and becomes aware of itself as an abstract ego. Only this pure ego now is not immediate, is not the familiar, ordinary ego of our consciousness to which the science of logic could be directly linked for everyone. That act, strictly speaking, would be nothing else but the elevation to the standpoint of pure knowing where the distinction of subject and object has vanished. But as thus&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediately&nbsp;</em>demanded, this elevation is a subjective postulate; to prove itself a genuine demand, the progression of the concrete ego from immediate consciousness to pure knowing must have been indicated and exhibited through the necessity of the ego itself. Without this objective movement pure knowing, even in the shape of intellectual intuition, appears as an arbitrary standpoint, or even as one of the empirical&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">states&nbsp;</em>of consciousness with respect to which everything turns on whether or not it is found or can be produced in each and every individual. But inasmuch as this pure ego must be essential, pure knowing, and pure knowing is not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediately&nbsp;</em>present in the individual consciousness but only as posited through the absolute act of the ego in raising itself to that stand-point, we lose the very advantage which is supposed to come from this beginning of philosophy namely that it is something thoroughly familiar, something everyone finds in himself which can form the starting point for further reflection; that pure ego, on the contrary, in its abstract, essential nature, is something unknown to the ordinary consciousness, something it does not find therein. Instead, such a beginning brings with it the disadvantage of the illusion that whereas the thing under discussion is supposed to be something familiar, the ego of empirical self-consciousness, it is in fact something far removed from it. When pure knowing is characterised as ego, it acts as a perpetual reminder of the subjective ego whose limitations should be forgotten, and it fosters the idea that the propositions and relations resulting from the further development of the ego are present and can already be found in the ordinary consciousness &mdash; for in fact it is this of which they are asserted. This confusion, far from clarifying the problem of a beginning, only adds to the difficulties involved and tends completely to mislead; among the uninitiated it has given rise to the crudest misunderstandings.</p>

But what, at the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beginning&nbsp;</em>of the science, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actually present&nbsp;</em>of intellectual intuition &ndash; or of the eternal, the divine, the absolute, if its object be so named &ndash; cannot be anything else than a first, immediate, simple determination. Whatever richer name be given to it than is expressed by mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being,&nbsp;</em>the consideration of such absolute must be restricted solely to the way in which it enters into our knowing as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thought&nbsp;</em>and is enunciated as such. True, intellectual intuition is the forcible rejection of mediation and the ratiocinative, external reflection; but what it enunciates above and beyond simple immediacy is something concrete, something which contains within itself diverse determinations. However, as we have remarked, the enunciation and exposition of such concrete beginning is a process of mediation which starts from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one&nbsp;</em>of the determinations and advances to the other, even though the latter returns to the first; it is a movement which at the same time may not be arbitrary or assertoric. Consequently, it is not the concrete something itself with which that exposition begins but only the simple immediacy from which the movement starts. And further, if something concrete is taken as the beginning, the conjunction of the determinations contained in it demand proof, and this is lacking.</p>

As regards the divergence of this classification from the usual presentation of the categories, namely, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantity, quality, relation</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">modality</em>&nbsp;&mdash; these moreover with Kant are supposed to be only titles for his categories though they are, in fact, themselves categories, only more general ones &mdash; this calls for no special comment here, as the entire exposition will show a complete divergence from the usual arrangement and significance of the categories.</p>

It has already been shown that the beginning is made with being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as such,&nbsp;</em>therefore, with qualitative being. It is easily seen from a comparison of quality with quantity that the former by its nature is first. For quantity is quality which has already become negative;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">magnitude</em>&nbsp;is the determinateness which is no longer one with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>but is already differentiated from it, sublated quality which has become indifferent. It includes the alterableness of being, although the category itself, namely Being, of which it is the determination, is not altered by it. The qualitative determinateness, on the other hand, is one with its being: it neither goes beyond it nor is internal to it, but is its immediate limitedness. Quality therefore, as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate</em>&nbsp;determinateness, is primary and it is with it that the beginning must be made.</p>

Here, however, nothing is to be taken in its indeterminate simplicity. Should it be held more correct to oppose to being,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-being&nbsp;</em>instead of nothing, there would be no objection to this so far as the result is concerned, for in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-being&nbsp;</em>the relation&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">to being&nbsp;</em>is contained: both being and its negation are enunciated in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">single&nbsp;</em>term, nothing, as it is in becoming. But we are concerned first of all not with the form of opposition (with the form, that is, also of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation)&nbsp;</em>but with the abstract, immediate negation: nothing, purely on its own account, negation devoid of any relations &mdash; what could also be expressed if one so wished merely by &#39;not&#39;.</p>

As we know, in the oriental systems, principally in Buddhism,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing,&nbsp;</em>the void, is the absolute principle. Against that simple and one-sided abstraction the deep-thinking Heraclitus brought forward the higher, total concept of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming&nbsp;</em>and said:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>as little&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is,&nbsp;</em>as nothing is, or,&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);"><em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">all flows</em></span>, which means,&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">all is a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming</em></span>. The popular, especially oriental proverbs, that all that exists has the germ of death in its very birth, that death, on the other hand, is the entrance into new life, express at bottom the same union of being and nothing. But these expressions have a substratum in which the transition takes place; being and nothing are held apart in time, are conceived as alternating in it, but are not thought in their abstraction and consequently, too, not so that they are in themselves absolutely the same.&nbsp;</p>

In it is to be seen either only the empty tautology: nothing is nothing; or, if&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming is</em>&nbsp;supposed to possess an actual meaning in it, then, since from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing only nothing becomes,&nbsp;</em>the proposition does not in fact contain&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming,&nbsp;</em>for in it nothing remains nothing. Becoming implies that nothing does not remain nothing but passes into its other, into being. Later, especially Christian, metaphysics whilst rejecting the proposition that out of nothing comes nothing, asserted a transition from nothing into being; although it understood this proposition synthetically or merely imaginatively, yet even in the most imperfect union there is contained a point in which being and nothing coincide and their distinguishedness vanishes. The proposition: out of nothing comes nothing, nothing is just nothing, owes its peculiar importance to its opposition to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming&nbsp;</em>generally, and consequently also to its opposition to the creation of the world from nothing. Those who maintain the proposition: nothing is just nothing, and even grow heated in its defence, are unaware that in so doing they are subscribing to the abstract pantheism of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Eleatics,&nbsp;</em>and also in principle to that of Spinoza. The philosophical view for which &#39;being is only being, nothing is only nothing&#39;, is a valid principle, merits the name of &#39;system of identity&#39;; this abstract identity is the essence of pantheism.</p>

The same must be said of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being and nothing</em>, as was said above about immediacy and mediation (which latter contains a reference to an other, and hence to<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation</em>), that&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">nowhere in heaven or on earth is there anything which does not contain within itself both being and nothing</span>. Of course, since we are speaking here of a particular&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actual something</em>, those determinations are no longer present in it in the complete untruth in which they are as being and nothing; they are in a more developed determination, and are grasped, for example, as positive and negative, the former being posited, reflected being, the latter posited, reflected nothing; the positive contains as its abstract basis being, and the negative, nothing. Thus in God himself,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quality&nbsp;</em>(energy, creation, power, and so forth), essentially involves the determination of the negative-they are the producing of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other.&nbsp;</em>But an empirical elucidation by examples of the said assertion would be altogether superfluous here. Since the unity of being and nothing as the primary truth now forms once and for all the basis and element of all that follows, besides&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming itself,</em>&nbsp;all further logical determinations: determinate being, quality, and generally all philosophical Notions, are examples of this unity. But self-styled sound common sense, if it rejects the unseparatedness of being and nothing, may be set the task of trying to discover an example in which the one is found separated from the other&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">(something from&nbsp;</em>limit&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">or limitation,&nbsp;</em>or, as just mentioned, the infinite, God, from energy or activity). Only the empty figments of thought, being and nothing themselves are these separated things and it is these that are preferred by &#39;sound common sense&#39; to the truth, to the unseparatedness of both which is everywhere before us.</p>

This inference from, or application of, the proposition completely alters its meaning. The proposition contains the pure abstractions of being and nothing; but the application converts them into a determinate being and a determinate nothing. But as we have said, the question here is not of determinate being.&nbsp;<a name="HL1_86"></a>A determinate, a finite, being is one that is in relation to another; it is a content standing in a necessary relation to another content, to the whole world. As regards the reciprocally determining context of the whole, metaphysics could make the &mdash; at bottom tautological &mdash; assertion that if a speck of dust were destroyed the whole universe would collapse. In the instances against the proposition in question something appears as not indifferent to whether it is or is not, not on account of being or non-being, but on account of its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content,&nbsp;</em>which brings it into relation with something else. If a specific content, any determinate being, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposed,&nbsp;</em>then because it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate</em>, it is in a manifold relationship with another content; it is not a matter of indifference to it whether a certain other content with which it is in relation is, or is not; for it is only through such relation that it essentially is what it is. The same is the case in the ordinary way of thinking (taking non-being in the more specific sense of such way of thinking as contrasted with actuality) in the context of which the being or the absence of a content, which, as determinate, is conceived as in relation to another, is not a matter of indifference.</p>

As we know, there was presupposed in that so-called proof the concept of a being possessing all realities, including therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existence,&nbsp;</em>which was likewise assumed as one of the realities. The main thesis of the Kantian criticism was that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existence&nbsp;</em>or being (these being taken here as synonymous) is not a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">property&nbsp;</em>or a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">real predicate,&nbsp;</em>that is to say, is not a concept of something which could be added to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concept</em>&nbsp;of a thing. By this Kant means to say that being is not a determination of the content of a thing.&#39; Therefore, he goes on to say, the possible does not contain more than the actual; a hundred actual dollars do not contain a whit more than a hundred possible ones; that is, the content of the former has no other determination than has the content of the latter. If this content is considered as isolated, it is indeed a matter of indifference whether it is, or is not; it contains no distinction of being or non-being, this difference does not affect it at all. The hundred dollars do not diminish if they do not exist, or increase if they do. A difference must come only from elsewhere. &#39;On the other hand,&#39; Kant reminds us, &#39;my fortune benefits more from a hundred actual dollars than from the mere concept of them or from their possibility. For in actuality,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the object&nbsp;</em>is not merely contained analytically in my concept, but is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">added synthetically to my concept&nbsp;</em>(which is a determination of my state), although the hundred dollars in my thought are not themselves increased one whit by this being which they have apart from my concept.&#39;</p>

For the one as for the other, my fortune and the figurate conception, a hundred dollars are a determination of a content or, as Kant expresses it, &#39;they are added to such a concept synthetically&#39;; I as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">possessor&nbsp;</em>of a hundred dollars or as not possessing them, or even I as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">imagining&nbsp;</em>or not imagining them, is of course a different content. Stated more generally: the abstractions of being and nothing both cease to be abstractions if they acquire a determinate content; being is then reality, the determinate being of a hundred dollars; nothing is the negation, the determinate non-being of them. This determinate content itself, the hundred dollars, also grasped isolatedly in abstraction is unchanged the same in the one as it is in the other. But since, furthermore, being is taken as a state of my fortune, the hundred dollars stand in relation to this state, as regards which the determinateness which they are is not a matter of indifference; their being or non-being is only an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alteration;&nbsp;</em>they are transposed into the sphere of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate being.&nbsp;</em>When, therefore, it is urged against the unity of being and nothing that it is nevertheless not a matter of indifference whether anything (the hundred dollars) is, or is not, we practise the deception of converting the difference between whether I&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">have or have not&nbsp;</em>the hundred dollars into a difference between being and non-being-a deception based, as we have shown, on the one-sided abstraction which ignores the determinate being present in such examples and holds fast merely to being and non-being, just as, conversely, the abstract being and nothing which should be apprehended is transformed into a definite being and nothing, into a determinate being.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Determinate being&nbsp;</em>is the first category to contain the real difference of being and nothing, namely,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something and other.&nbsp;</em>It is this real difference which is vaguely present in ordinary thinking, instead of abstract being and pure nothing and their only imagined difference.</p>

But this so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concept&nbsp;</em>of the hundred dollars is a spurious concept; the form of simple self-relation does not belong to such a limited, finite content itself; it is a borrowed form attached to it by the subjective understanding; the being of the hundred dollars is not self-related but alterable and perishable.</p>

This criticism, through its popular example, has made itself universally plausible: who does not know that a hundred actual dollars are different from a hundred merely possible ones? that they make a difference to the state of my fortune? Because this difference is so obvious with the hundred dollars, therefore the concept, that is, the specific nature of the content as an empty possibility, and being, are different from each other;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">therefore&nbsp;</em>the Notion of God too is different from his being, and just as little as I can extract from the possibility of the hundred dollars their actuality, just as little can I extract from the Notion of God his existence; but the onotological proof is supposed to consist of this extraction of the existence of God from his Notion. Now though it is of course true that Notion is different from being, there is a still greater difference between God and the hundred dollars and other finite things. It is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">definition of finite things&nbsp;</em>that in them the Notion is different from being, that Notion and reality, soul and body, are separable and hence that they are perishable and mortal; the abstract definition of God, on the other hand, is precisely that his Notion and his being are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unseparated and inseparable.&nbsp;</em>The genuine criticism of the categories and of reason is just this: to make intellect aware of this difference and to prevent it from applying to God the determinations and relationships of the finite.</p>

The emphasis is laid chiefly on their being one and the same, as in judgments generally, where it is the predicate that first states what the subject is. Consequently, the sense seems to be that the difference is denied, although at the same time it appears directly in the proposition; for this enunciates both determinations, being and nothing, and contains them as distinguished. At the same time, the intention cannot be that abstraction should be made from them and only the unity retained. Such a meaning would self-evidently be one-sided, because that from which abstraction is to be made is equally present and named in the proposition. Now in so far as the proposition: being and nothing are the same, asserts the identity of these determinations, but, in fact, equally contains them both as distinguished, the proposition is self-contradictory and cancels itself out. Bearing this in mind and looking at the proposition more closely, we find that it has a movement which involves the spontaneous vanishing of the proposition itself. But in thus vanishing, there takes place in it that which is to constitute its own peculiar content, namely,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming.</em></p>

In this connection we must, at the outset, make this general observation, namely, that the proposition in the form&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of a judgment&nbsp;</em>is not suited to express speculative truths; a familiarity with this fact is likely to remove many misunderstandings of speculative truths. Judgment is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identical&nbsp;</em>relation between subject and predicate; in it we abstract from the fact that the subject has a number of determinatenesses other than that of the predicate, and also that the predicate is more extensive than the subject. Now if the content is speculative, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-identical&nbsp;</em>aspect of subject and predicate is also an essential moment, but in the judgment this is not expressed. It is the form of simple judgment, when it is used to express speculative results, which is very often responsible for the paradoxical and bizarre light in which much of recent philosophy appears to those who are not familiar with speculative thought.</p>

But thus there arises the further defect that these propositions are not connected, and therefore exhibit their content only in the form of an antinomy whereas their content refers to one and the same thing, and the determinations which are expressed in the two propositions are supposed to be in complete union-a union which can only be stated as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unrest of incompatibles,&nbsp;</em>as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">movement.&nbsp;</em>The commonest injustice done to a speculative content is to make it one-sided, that is, to give prominence only to one of the propositions into which it can be resolved. It cannot then be denied that this proposition is asserted;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">but the statement is just as false as it is true,&nbsp;</em>for once one of the propositions is taken out of the speculative content, the other must at least be equally considered and stated. Particular mention must be made here of that, so to speak, unfortunate word, &#39;unity&#39;. Unity, even more than identity, expresses a subjective reflection; it is taken especially as the relation which arises from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comparison,</em>from external reflection. When this reflection finds the same thing in two&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">different objects,</em>&nbsp;the resultant unity is such that there is presupposed the complete&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifference&nbsp;</em>to it of the objects themselves which are compared, so that this comparing and unity does not concern the objects themselves and is a procedure and a determining external to them. Unity, therefore, expresses wholly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract</em>sameness and sounds all the more blatantly paradoxical the more the terms of which it is asserted show themselves to be sheer opposites. So far then, it would be better to, say only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unseparatedness and inseparability,</em>&nbsp;but then the affirmative aspect of the relation of the whole would not find expression.</p>

Their difference is therefore completely empty, each of them is in the same way indeterminate; the difference, then, exists not in themselves but in a third, in subjective opinion. Opinion, however, is a form of subjectivity which is not proper to an exposition of this kind.&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">But the third in which being and nothing subsist must also present itself here, and it has done so; it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming</em></span>.

Without having satisfied this first requirement of the ancient science whose logical rules they accept as valid and apply in other cases, all that they maintain about being and nothing amounts only to assertions which are scientifically worthless. If elsewhere it has been said that existence, in so far as this at first is held to be synonymous with being, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">complement to possibility,&nbsp;</em>then this presupposes another determination, possibility, and so being is not enunciated in its immediacy, but in fact as not self-subsistent, as conditioned.

But, as a matter of fact, if this very seeing is more exactly imagined, one can readily perceive that in absolute clearness there is seen just as much, and as little, as in absolute darkness, that the one seeing is as good as the other, that pure seeing is a seeing of nothing. Pure light and pure darkness are two voids which are the same thing. Something can be distinguished only in determinate light or darkness (light is determined by darkness and so is darkened light, and darkness is determined by light, is illuminated darkness), and for this reason, that it is only darkened light and illuminated darkness which have within themselves the moment of difference and are, therefore,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>being.</p>

Now wherever and in whatever form being and nothing are in question, this third must be present; for the two terms have no separate subsistence of their own but are only in becoming, in this third. But this third has many empirical shapes, which are set aside or ignored by abstraction in order to hold fast, each by itself, these its products, being and nothing, and to show them protected against transition. Such simple procedure of abstraction can be countered, equally simply, by calling to mind the empirical existence in which that abstraction is itself only a something having a determinate being. Or else it is some other form of reflection which is supposed to effect the separation of what is inseparable. Such determination carries within itself its own opposite, and, without referring back and appealing to the nature of the thing itself, the determination of reflection can be refuted in its own self by taking it just as it presents itself and pointing out in it its own other. It would be favour in vain to attempt to intercept all the shifts and turns of reflection and its arguments in order to cut off and render impossible to it all the evasions and digressions by which it conceals from itself its own self-contradiction. For this reason I, too, refrain from taking notice of many of the so-called objections and refutations which have been advanced against the proposition that neither being nor nothing truly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is,&nbsp;</em>but that their truth is only becoming. The intellectual training which alone can afford an insight into the nullity of such refutations, or rather spontaneously dispell such random fancies, is effected only by a critical knowledge of the forms of the understanding; but those who are most prolific with such objections straightway launch their reflections against the first propositions without first acquiring or having acquired, by a further study of logic, an awareness of the nature of these crude reflections.</p>

Thus Fichte&#39;s absolutely primary, unconditioned principle: A = A, is thesis; the second is antithesis. This latter is supposed to be partly conditioned, partly unconditioned (and so an internal contradiction). This is a progress by external reflection which, having negated the absolute with which it began-the antithesis is the negation of the first identity-straightway expressly converts its second&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unconditioned&nbsp;</em>into a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">conditioned.&nbsp;</em>But if there were any justification at all for the progress, that is, for sublating the first beginning, then this first would itself have to be of such a nature that an other could connect itself with it; and therefore it would have to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate.&nbsp;</em>But neither&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being,&nbsp;</em>nor even absolute substance, claims to be such: on the contrary.

Whence does its pure vowel get its consonant, or rather how does its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">soundless, uninterrupted&nbsp;</em>sounding interrupt itself and break off in order to gain at least a kind of &#39;self-sound&#39; (vowel), an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">accent</em>?&rdquo; It is evident that Jacobi recognised very clearly the insubstantial nature, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non ens,&nbsp;</em>of abstraction, whether so-called absolute (i.e. only abstract) space, or abstract time, or abstract pure consciousness, the ego; he remains fixed in such abstraction in order to maintain the impossibility of a transition to an other (the condition of a synthesis), and to the synthesis itself. The synthesis, which is the point of interest, must not be taken as a connection of determinations already&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externally&nbsp;</em>there; the question is partly of the genesis of a second to a first, of a determinate to an indeterminate first principle, partly, however,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of immanent&nbsp;</em>synthesis, synthesis&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a priori &mdash; a&nbsp;</em>self-subsistent, self-determined unity of distinct moments.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Becoming&nbsp;</em>is this immanent synthesis of being and nothing; but because synthesis suggests more than anything else the sense of an external bringing together of mutually external things already there, the name synthesis, synthetic unity, has rightly been dropped. Jacobi asks how does the pure vowel of the ego get its consonant, what brings determinateness into indeterminateness? The what would be easy to answer and has been answered by Kant in his own manner; but the question how means: in what peculiar manner, in what relationship, and so forth, and thus demands the statement of a particular category; but there can be no question here of a peculiar manner, of categories of the understanding. The very question how itself belongs to the bad habits of reflection, which demands comprehensibility, but at the same time presupposes its own fixed categories and consequently knows beforehand that it is armed against the answering of its own question. Neither has it with Jacobi the higher sense of a question concerning the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessity&nbsp;</em>of the synthesis; for he remains, as has been said, fixed in the abstractions in order to maintain the impossibility of the synthesis. Especially graphic is his description of the procedure for reaching the abstraction of space. &lsquo;For a time I must try clean to forget that I ever saw, heard, touched or handled anything at all, myself expressly not excepted. Clean, clean, clean must I forget all movement, and precisely this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">forgetting,&nbsp;</em>because it is hardest, I must make my greatest concern. just as I have thought away everything in general, so I must also completely and entirely get rid of it, retaining nothing but the forcibly arrested intuition alone of infinite&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immutable space.&nbsp;</em>I may not therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">again think into it&nbsp;</em>my own self as something distinct from it and yet connected with it; I may not let myself be merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">surrounded and pervaded</em>&nbsp;by it: but I must wholly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pass over&nbsp;</em>into it, become one with it, transform myself into it; I must leave nothing over of myself but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this my intuition&nbsp;</em>itself, in order to contemplate it as a genuinely self-subsistent, independent, single and sole conception.&rsquo;</p>

The empirical<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transition,&nbsp;</em>moreover, is self-evident; consciousness can of course make empty space, empty time, and even empty consciousness itself or pure being, its object and content, but it does not stop at that; it goes beyond it or rather presses forward out of such a vacuity to a better content, that is, to a content which in some way or other is more concrete, and which to that extent is better and truer however bad it may be in other respects; just such a content is in general synthetic, this word being taken in its more general sense. Thus Parmenides has to reckon with illusion and opinion, the opposite of being and truth; Spinoza likewise, with attributes, modes, extension, movement, understanding, will, and so on. The synthesis contains and demonstrates the falsity of those abstractions; in it they are in unity with their other, not, therefore, as independently self-subsistent, not as absolute, but purely as relative.</p>

Consciousness by making abstraction can, of course, fill itself with such indeterminates also and the abstractions thus held fast are the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thoughts&nbsp;</em>of pure space, pure time, pure consciousness, or pure being. It is the thought of pure space, etc. &mdash; that is, pure space, etc.,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own&nbsp;</em>self &mdash; that is to be demonstrated as null: that it is as such already its own opposite, that its opposite has already penetrated into it, that it is already by itself the accomplished coming-forth-from-itself, a determinateness.</p>

They are, as Jacobi profusely describes them, results of abstraction; they are expressly determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indeterminate&nbsp;</em>and this &mdash; to go back to its simplest form &mdash; is being. But it is this very&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indeterminateness&nbsp;</em>which constitutes its determinateness; for indeterminateness is opposed to determinateness; hence as so opposed it is itself determinate or the negative, and the pure, quite abstract negative. It is this indeterminateness or abstract negation which thus has being present within it, which reflection, both outer and inner, enunciates when it equates it with nothing, declares it to be an empty product of thought, to be nothing. Or it can be expressed thus: because being is devoid of all determination whatsoever, it is not the (affirmative) determinateness which it is; it is not being but nothing.</p>

But, it may be continued, the beginning is thus not an affirmative, not being, but just nothing, and nothing is then also the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">end,&nbsp;</em>at least as much as immediate being, and even more so. The shortest way is to let such reasoning take its course and then wait and see what is the nature of its boasted results. That&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing&nbsp;</em>would be the result of such reasoning and that now the beginning should be made with nothing (as in Chinese philosophy), need not cause us to lift a finger, for before we could do so this nothing would no less have converted itself into being (see Section B above). But further, this abstraction from everything (which &#39;everything&#39; nevertheless is an affirmative being) having been presupposed, then it must be understood more exactly; the result of making abstraction from all that is, is first of all abstract being,<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being</em>&nbsp;as such; just as in the cosmological proof of the existence of God from the contingent being of the world, in which proof we rise above such contingent being,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>is still taken up with us in our ascent and is determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite being.&nbsp;</em>Of course, one&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">can&nbsp;</em>also abstract from this pure being, being can be thrown in with the all from which abstraction has already been made; then nothing remains. Now if we want to forget the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thinking of nothing,</em>&nbsp;that is, its conversion into being, or are ignorant of it, we&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">can</em>&nbsp;proceed in the style of &#39;one&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">can&#39;;&nbsp;</em>we can for example (God be praised!) also abstract from nothing (for the creation of the world, too, is an abstraction from nothing), and then what remains is not nothing, for it is just from this that we have made abstraction; we have in fact arrived at being again. This, &#39;one can&#39;, gives an external play of abstraction, in which the abstracting itself is only the one-sided activity of the negative. It is directly implied in this very form of &#39;one can&#39;, that for it being is just as indifferent as nothing, and that with the vanishing of either of them there is equally an arising of the other; but it is equally a matter of indifference whether one starts from the doing of nothing, or from nothing; for the former, that is the mere abstracting, has neither more nor less of truth in it than mere nothing has.</p>

Nothing, it is said, is only the absence of being, darkness thus only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absence&nbsp;</em>of light, cold only absence of heat, and so on. And darkness only has meaning in relation to the eye, in external comparison with the positive factor, light, and similarly cold is only something in our sensation; on the other hand, light and heat, like being, are objective, active realities on their own account, and are of quite another quality and dignity than this negative, than nothing. One can often find it put forward as a weighty reflection and an important piece of information that&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">darkness is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only the absence</em>&nbsp;of light</span>, cold&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only absence</em>of heat. About this acute reflection in this field of empirical objects, it can be observed that darkness does in fact show itself active in light, determining it to colour and thereby imparting visibility to it, since, as was said above,&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">just as little is seen in pure light as in pure darkness</span>. Visibility, however, is effected in the eye, and the supposed negative has just as much a share in this as the light which is credited with being the real, positive factor; similarly, cold makes its presence known in water, in our sensations etc., and if we deny it so-called objective reality it is not a whit the worse for our doing so. But a further objection would be that here, too, as before, it is a negative with a determinate content that is spoken of, the argument is not confined to pure nothing, to which being, regarded as an empty abstraction, is neither inferior nor superior. But cold, darkness, and similar determinate negations are to be taken directly as they are by themselves and we shall then see what we have thereby effected in respect of their universal determination which has led them to be introduced here. They are supposed to be not just nothing but the nothing of light, heat, etc., of something determinate, of a content; thus they are a determinate, a contentful, nothing if one may so speak. But, as will subsequently appear, a determinateness is itself a negation, and so they are negative nothings; but a negative nothing is an affirmative something. The conversion of nothing through its determinateness (which previously appeared as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>being in a subject thinker, or in some other form) into an affirmative, appears to the consciousness which is fixed in the abstraction of the understanding as the acme of paradox; the insight that the negation of the negation is something positive, simple as it is, or rather because of its very simplicity, appears as a triviality to which haughty understanding need pay no heed, although the correctness of the insight is admitted-and the insight is not only correct, but, because of the universality of such determinations, it has its infinite extension and universal application, so that it were indeed well to pay attention to it.</p>

It is immediate and quite abstract because the transient moments are themselves abstract, that is, because the determinateness of either moment by means of which they passed over into each other is not yet posited in the other; nothing is not yet&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>in being, although it is true that being is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essentially</em>&nbsp;nothing, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vice versa.&nbsp;</em>It is therefore inadmissible to employ more developed forms of mediation here and to hold being and nothing in any kind of relationship-the transition in question is not yet a relation. Thus is it impermissible to say: nothing is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground&nbsp;</em>of being, or being is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground&nbsp;</em>of nothing or nothing is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">cause&nbsp;</em>of being, and so forth; or, transition into nothing can only occur&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">under the condition&nbsp;</em>that something is, or into being only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">under the condition&nbsp;</em>of non-being. The kind of connection cannot be further determined without the connected&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sides&nbsp;</em>being further determined at the same time. The connection of ground and consequent, etc., has no longer merely being and nothing as the sides which it connects, but expressly being which is a ground, and something which, although merely posited and not self-subsistent, is yet not the abstract nothing.</p>

The Kantian antinomy relative to the finitude or infinity of the world in space and time will be considered more closely under the Notion of quantitative infinity.

If the world, or anything, is supposed to have begun, then it must have begun in nothing, but in nothing &mdash; or nothing &mdash; is no beginning; for a beginning includes within itself a being, but nothing does not contain any being. Nothing is only nothing. In a ground, a cause, and so on, if nothing is so determined, there is contained an affirmation, a being. For the same reason, too, something cannot cease to be; for then being would have to contain nothing, but being is only being, not the contrary of itself.</p>

What is sublated is not thereby reduced to nothing. Nothing is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate</em>; what is sublated, on the other hand, is the result of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediation</em>; it is a non-being but as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">result</em>&nbsp;which had its origin in a being. It still has, therefore,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate from which it originates</em>.</p>

But it is certainly remarkable to find that a language has come to use one and the same word for two opposite meanings. It is a delight to speculative thought to find in the language words which have in themselves a speculative meaning; the German language has a number of such. The double meaning of the Latin&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">tollere&nbsp;</em>(which has become famous through the Ciceronian pun:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">tollendum est Octavium</em>) does not go so far; its affirmative determination signifies only a lifting-up. Something is sublated only in so far as it has entered into unity with its opposite; in this more particular signification as something reflected, it may fittingly be called a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moment.&nbsp;</em>In the case of the lever, weight and distance from a point are called its mechanical moments on account of the sameness of their effect, in spite of the contrast otherwise between something real, such as a weight, and something ideal, such as a mere spatial determination, a line.&#39; We shall often have occasion to notice that the technical language of philosophy employs Latin terms for reflected determinations, either because the mother tongue has no words for them or if it has, as here, because its expression calls to mind more what is immediate, whereas the foreign language suggests more what is reflected.</p>

Being and nothing are the same;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">but just because they are the same they are no longer being and nothing,&nbsp;</em>but now have a different significance. In becoming they were coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be; in determinate being, a differently determined unity, they are again differently determined moments. This unity now remains their base from which they do not again emerge in the abstract significance of being and nothing.</p>

Such reflections may facilitate a general view and thereby an understanding of the development, but they also have the disadvantage of appearing as unjustified assertions, grounds and foundations for what is to follow. They should therefore not be taken for more than they are supposed to be and should be distinguished from what is a moment in the development of the subject matter itself.</p>

In philosophy one may perhaps speak of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">merely empirical&nbsp;</em>reality as of a worthless existence. But when it is said that thoughts, concepts, theories&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">have no reality,&nbsp;</em>this means that they do not possess&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actuality; in itself&nbsp;</em>or in its notion, the idea of a Platonic Republic, for example, may well be true. Here the worth of the idea is not denied and it is left its place&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alongside&nbsp;</em>the reality. But as against mere ideas,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mere</em>notions, the real alone counts as true. The sense in which, on the one hand, outer existence is made the criterion of the truth of a content is no less one-sided than when the idea, essential being, or even inner feeling is represented as indifferent to outer existence and is even held to be the more excellent the more remote it is from reality.</p>

God was defined as the sum-total of all realities, and of this sum-total it was said that no contradiction was contained in it, that none of the realities cancelled any other; for a reality is to be taken only as a perfection, as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affirmative&nbsp;</em>being which contains no negation. Hence the realities are not opposed to one another and do not contradict one another.</p>

Reality is quality, determinate being; consequently, it contains the moment of the negative and is through this alone the determinate being that it is. Reality, taken as we are supposed to take it, in the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">eminent sense&nbsp;</em>or as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite</em>&nbsp;-in the usual meaning of the word-is expanded into indeterminateness and loses its meaning. God&#39;s goodness is not to be goodness in the ordinary, but in the eminent sense; not different from justice but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">tempered&nbsp;</em>by it (a mediatory expression used by Leibniz), just as, conversely, justice is tempered by goodness; and so goodness is no longer goodness, nor justice any more justice. Power is supposed to be tempered by wisdom, but in that case it is not power as such for it would be subject to wisdom; wisdom is supposed to be expanded into power, in which case it vanishes as the wisdom which determines the end and measure of things. The true Notion of the infinite and its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute</em>unity which will present itself later, is not to be understood as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">tempering, a reciprocal restricting&nbsp;</em>or a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mixing;&nbsp;</em>such a superficial conception of the relationship leaves it indefinite and nebulous and can satisfy only a Notion-less way of thinking. When reality, taken as a determinate quality as it is in the said definition of God, is extended beyond its determinateness it ceases to be reality and becomes abstract being; God as the pure reality in all realities, or as the sum total of all realities, is just as devoid of determinateness and content as the empty absolute in which all is one.</p>

The said reality in all realities, the being in all determinate being, which is supposed to express the concept of God, is nothing else than abstract being, which is the same as nothing.</p>

According to Spinoza&#39;s definition, of which more subsequently, the infinity of anything is its affirmation. He grasped them therefore as attributes, that is, as not having a separate existence, a self-subsistent being of their own, but only as sublated, as moments; or rather, since substance in its own self lacks any determination whatever, they are for him not even moments, and the attributes like the modes are distinctions made by an external intellect. Similarly, the substantiality of individuals cannot persist in the face of that proposition. The individual is a relation-to-self through its setting limits to everything else; but these limits are thereby also limits of itself, relations to an other, it does not possess its determinate being within itself. True, the individual is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more&nbsp;</em>than merely an entity bounded on all sides, but this more belongs to another sphere of the Notion; in the metaphysics of being, the individual is simply a determinate something, and in opposition to the independence and self-subsistence of such something, to the finite as such, determinateness effectively brings into play its essentially negative character, dragging what is finite into that same negative movement of the understanding which makes everything vanish in the abstract unity of substance.</p>

In our ordinary way of thinking,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something&nbsp;</em>is rightly credited with reality. However, something is still a very superficial determination; just as reality and negation, determinate being and its determinateness, although no longer blank being and nothing, are still quite abstract determinations. It is for this reason that they are the most current expressions and the intellect which is philosophically untrained uses them most, casts its distinctions in their mould and fancies that in them it has something really well and truly determined. The negative of the negative is, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something,&nbsp;</em>only the beginning of the subject [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Subjekt</em>] &mdash; being-within-self, only as yet quite indeterminate.

At the base of all these determinations lies the negative unity with itself. But in all this, care must be taken to distinguish between the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first&nbsp;</em>negation as negation in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">general,&nbsp;</em>and the second negation, the negation of the negation: the latter is concrete,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute&nbsp;</em>negativity, just as the former on the contrary is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract&nbsp;</em>negativity.</p>

It is immaterial which is first named and solely for that reason called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something;&nbsp;</em>(in Latin, when they both occur in a sentence, both are called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">aliud,&nbsp;</em>or &#39;the one, the other&#39;,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alius alium;&nbsp;</em>when there is reciprocity the expression&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alter alterum&nbsp;</em>is analogous).

The entire determinateness falls into this external pointing out; even the expression &#39;this&#39; contains no distinction; each and every something is just as well a &#39;this&#39; as it is also an other. By &#39;this&#39; we&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mean&nbsp;</em>to express something completely determined; it is overlooked that speech, as a work of the understanding, gives expression only to universals, except in the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">name&nbsp;</em>of a single object; but the individual name is meaningless, in the sense that it does not express a universal, and for the same reason appears as something merely posited and arbitrary; just as proper names, too, can be arbitrarily assumed, given or also altered.</p>

But in so doing it remains identical with itself, for that into which it alters is the other, and this is its sole determination; but what is altered is not determined in any different way but in the same way, namely, to be an other; in this latter, therefore, it only unites with its own self. It is thus posited as reflected into itself with sublation of the otherness, as a self-identical something from which, consequently, the otherness, which is at the same time a moment of it, is distinct from it and does not appertain to the something itself.</p>

There is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">present in them</em>their showing or reflection in each other, the showing or reflection in each of its other. In the different spheres of determination and especially in the progress of the exposition, or more precisely in the progress of the Notion towards the exposition of itself, it is of capital importance always clearly to distinguish what is still&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>and what is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited, the</em>&nbsp;determinations as they are in the Notion, and as they are as posited, or as being-for-other. This is a distinction which belongs only to the dialectical development and which is unknown to metaphysical philosophising, which also includes the critical philosophy; the definitions of metaphysics, like its presuppositions, distinctions and conclusions, seek to assert and produce only what comes under the category of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being,&nbsp;</em>and that, too, of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-in-itself.</em></p>

The simple middle term is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>as such; to its identity belongs both determination and constitution. But determination spontaneously passes over into constitution, and the latter into the former. This is implied in what has been said already; the connection is more precisely this: in so far as that which something is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>is also present&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in it,&nbsp;</em>it is burdened with being-for-other; hence the determination is, as such, open to relationship to other. The determinateness is at the same time a moment, but contains at the same time the qualitative distinction of being different from the in-itself, of being the negative of the something, another determinate being. The determinateness which thus holds the other within it, being united with the in-itself, brings the otherness into the latter or into the determination, which, consequently, is reduced to constitution. Conversely, being-for-other isolated as constitution and posited by itself, is in its own self the same as the other as such, the other in its own self, that is, the other of itself; but thus it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-related&nbsp;</em>determinate being, the in-itself with a determinateness, and therefore a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determination.&nbsp;</em>Consequently, in so far as determination and constitution are also to be held apart, the latter, which appears to be grounded in something external, in an other in general, also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">depends&nbsp;</em>on the former, and the determining from outside is at the same time determined by the something&#39;s own, immanent determination. But further, the constitution belongs to that which the something is in itself; something alters with its constitution.</p>

But the other is also qualitatively distinguished from this and is thus posited outside the something. The negation of its other is now the quality of the something, for it is as this sublating of its other that it is something.

As such, it is not distinguished from its other; it is only determinate being and therefore has the same determination as its other; each is only a something in general, or each is an other; thus both are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the same.&nbsp;</em>But this their primarily immediate determinate being is now posited with the determinateness as limit, in which both are what they are, distinguished from each other. Limit is, however, equally their common distinguishedness, their unity and distinguishedness, like determinate being. This double identity of both, of determinate being and limit, contains this: that something has its determinate being only in the limit, and that since the limit and the determinate being are each at the same time the negative of each other, the something, which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>only in its limit, just as much separates itself from itself and points beyond itself to its non-being, declaring this is to be its being and thus passing over into it. To apply this to the preceding example and taking first the determination that something is what it is only in its limit: as thus determined, the point is therefore the limit of the line, not merely in the sense that the line only ceases in the point, and as a determinate being is outside it; neither is the line the limit of the plane merely in the sense that the plane only ceases in it-and similarly with surface as limit of the solid; on the contrary, in the point the line also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">begins;&nbsp;</em>the point is its absolute beginning. Even when the line is represented as unlimited on either side, or, as it is put, is produced to infinity, the point still constitutes its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">element,&nbsp;</em>just as the line is the element of the plane, and the surface that of the solid. These limits are the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">principle</em>&nbsp;of that which they limit; just as one, for example as hundredth, is the limit, but also the element, of the whole hundred.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">The other determination is the unrest of the something in its limit in which it is immanent, an unrest which is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contradiction</em>&nbsp;which impels the something out beyond itself. Thus the point is this dialectic of its own self to become a line, the line the dialectic to become a plane, and the plane the dialectic to become total space. A second definition is given of line, plane and total space: namely, that the line originates through the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">movement&nbsp;</em>of the point, the plane through the movement of the line, and so on. But this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">movement&nbsp;</em>of the point, line and so on, is regarded as something contingent or as only thus imagined. This point of view is, however, really retracted in so far as the determinations from which the line and so on are supposed to originate are their elements and principles which, at the same time, are nothing else but their limits; and so the origin is not considered as contingent or as only thus imagined. That point, line and plane by themselves are self-contradictory, are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beginnings&nbsp;</em>which spontaneously repel themselves from themselves, so that the point, through its Notion, passes out of itself into the line,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moves in itself&nbsp;</em>and gives rise to the line, and so on, lies in the Notion of limit which is immanent in the something. The application itself, however, belongs to the consideration of space; to give an indication of it here, the point is the wholly abstract limit,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">but in a determinate being;&nbsp;</em>this is taken as still wholly abstract, it is so-called absolute, that is, abstract&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">space,&nbsp;</em>a purely continuous asunderness. But the limit is not abstract negation, but is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in this determinate being,&nbsp;</em>is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">spatial</em>determinateness; the point is, therefore, spatial, the contradiction of abstract negation and continuity, and is, therefore, the transition, the accomplished transition into the line, and so on; just as also, for the same reason,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">there is&nbsp;</em>no such thing as a point, line or plane.</p>

Because of this qualitative singleness of the negation, which has gone back to the abstract opposition of nothing and ceasing-to-be as opposed to being, finitude is the most stubborn category of the understanding; negation in general, constitution and limit, reconcile themselves with their other, with determinate being; and even nothing, taken abstractly as such, is given up as an abstraction; but finitude is the negation<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as fixed in itself,&nbsp;</em>and it therefore stands in abrupt contrast to its affirmative. The finite, it is true, lest itself be brought into flux, it is itself this, to be determined or destined to its end, but only to its end &mdash; or rather, it is the refusal to let itself be brought affirmatively to its affirmative, to the infinite, and to let itself be united with it; it is therefore posited as inseparable from its nothing, and is thereby cut off from all reconciliation with its other, the affirmative. The determination or destiny of finite things takes them no further than their<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">end.&nbsp;</em>The understanding persists in this sadness of finitude by making non-being the determination of things and at the same time making it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">imperishable and absolute.&nbsp;</em>Their transitoriness could only pass away or perish in their other, in the affirmative; their finitude would then be parted from them; but it is their unalterable quality, that is, their quality which does not pass over into its other, that is, into its affirmative;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">it is thus eternal</em></p>

But the point is, whether in thinking of the finite one holds fast to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>of finitude and lets the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transitoriness&nbsp;</em>continue to be, or whether the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transitoriness</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ceasing-to-be cease to be.&nbsp;</em>But it is precisely in that view of the finite which makes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ceasing-to-be&nbsp;</em>the final determination of the finite, that this does not happen. It is the express assertion that the finite is irreconcilable with the infinite and cannot be united with it, that the finite is utterly opposed to the infinite. Being, absolute being, is ascribed to the infinite; confronting it, the finite thus remains held fast as its negative; incapable of union with the infinite, it remains absolute on its own side; from the affirmative, from the infinite, it would receive affirmation, and would thus cease to be; but a union with the infinite is just what is declared to be impossible. If it is not to remain fixed in its opposition to the infinite but is to cease to be, then, as we have already said, just this ceasing-to-be is its final determination, not the affirmative which would be only the ceasing to be of the ceasing-to-be. If, however, the finite is not to pass way in the affirmative, but its end is to be grasped as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing,&nbsp;</em>then we should be back again at that first, abstract nothing which itself has long since passed away.</p>

But further, since the otherness is determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limit,&nbsp;</em>as itself negation of the negation, the otherness immanent in the something is posited as the connection of the two sides, and the unity with itself of the something which possesses both determination and constitution, is its relation turned towards its own self, the relation of its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicit&nbsp;</em>determination to the limit immanent in the something, a relation in which this immanent limit is negated. The self-identical being-within-self thus relates itself to itself as its own non-being, but as negation of the negation, as negating the non-being which at the same time retains in it determinate being, for determinate being is the quality of its being-within-self.

For a determinateness, a limit, is determined as a limitation only in opposition to its other in general, that is, in opposition to that which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">free from the limitation;&nbsp;</em>the other of a limitation is precisely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being beyond&nbsp;</em>it. Stone and metal do not transcend their limitation because this is not a limitation for&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">them.&nbsp;</em>If, however, in the case of such general propositions framed by the understanding, such as that limitation cannot be transcended, thought will not apply itself to finding out what is implied in the Notion, then it can be directed to the world of actuality where such proportions show themselves to be completely unreal. just because thought is<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">supposed&nbsp;</em>to be superior to actuality, to dwell apart from it in higher regions and therefore to be itself determined as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ought-to-be,&nbsp;</em>on the one hand, it does not advance to the Notion, and, on the other hand, it stands in just as untrue a relation to actuality as it does to the Notion.</p>

But even the stone, as a something, contains the distinction of its determination or in-itself and its determinate being, and to that extent it, too, transcends its limitation; the Notion which is implicit in it contains the identity of the stone with its other.&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">If it is a base capable of being acted on by an acid, then it can be oxidised</span>, and neutralised, and so on. In oxidation, neutralisation and so on, it overcomes its limitation of existing only as a base; it transcends it, and similarly the acid overcomes its limitation of being an acid. This ought, the obligation to transcend limitations, is present in both acid and caustic base in such a degree that it is only by force that they can be kept fixed as (waterless, that is, purely non-neutral) acid and caustic base.</p>

The plant transcends the limitation of being a seed, similarly, of being blossom, fruit, leaf; the seed becomes the developed plant, the blossom fades away, and so on. The sentient creature, in the limitation of hunger, thirst, etc., is the urge to overcome this limitation and it does overcome it. It feels&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pain,</em>and it is the privilege of the sentient nature to feel pain; it is a negation in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self,&nbsp;</em>and the negation is determined as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limitation&nbsp;</em>in its feeling, just because the sentient creature has the feeling of its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self,&nbsp;</em>which is the totality that transcends this determinateness. If it were not above and beyond the determinateness, it would not feel it as its negation and would feel no pain.</p>

Therefore, it has its place and its validity in the sphere of finitude where it holds fast to being-in-itself in opposition to limitedness, declaring the former to be the regulative and essential factor relatively to what is null. Duty is an ought directed against the particular will, against self-seeking desire and capricious interest and it is held up as an ought to the will in so far as this has the capacity to isolate itself from the true. Those who attach such importance to the ought of morality and fancy that morality is destroyed if the ought is not recognized as ultimate truth, and those too who, reasoning from the level of the understanding, derive a perpetual satisfaction from being able to confront everything there is with an ought, that is, with a &#39;knowing better&#39; &mdash; and for that very reason are just as loath to be robbed of the ought &mdash; do not see that as regards the finitude of their sphere the ought receives full recognition. But in the world of actuality itself, Reason and Law are not in such a bad way that they only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ought&nbsp;</em>to be &mdash; it is only the abstraction of the in-itself that stops at this-any more than the ought is in its own self perennial and, what is the same thing, that finitude is absolute. The philosophy of Kant and Fichte sets up the ought as the highest point of the resolution of the contradictions of Reason; but the truth is that the ought is only the standpoint which clings to finitude and thus to contradiction.</p>

Their relation to each other is the finite itself which contains them both in its being-within-self. These moments of its determination are qualitatively opposed; limitation is determined as the negative of the ought and the ought likewise as the negative of limitation. The finite is thus inwardly self-contradictory; it sublates itself, ceases to be. But this its result, the negative as such, is [a] its very&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determination;&nbsp;</em>for it is the negative of the negative. Thus, in ceasing to be, the finite has not ceased to be; it has become in the first instance only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another&nbsp;</em>finite which, however, is equally a ceasing-to-be as transition into another finite, and so on to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinity.&nbsp;</em>But [b] closer consideration of this result shows that the finite in its ceasing-to-be, in this negation of itself has attained its being-in-itself, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">united with itself.&nbsp;</em>Each of its moments contains precisely this result; the ought transcends the limitation, that is, transcends itself; but beyond itself or its other, is only the limitation itself. The limitation, however, points directly beyond itself to its other, which is the ought; but this latter is the same duality of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-in-itself and determinate being</em>as the limitation; it is the same thing; in going beyond itself, therefore, it equally only unites with itself. This&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identity with itself,&nbsp;</em>the negation of negation, is affirmative being and thus the other of the finite, of the finite which is supposed to have the first negation for its determinateness; this other is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite.</em></p>

Finitude, namely, is limitation posited as limitation; determinate being is posited with the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determination&nbsp;</em>to pass over into its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">to become&nbsp;</em>infinite. Infinity is the nothing of the finite, it is what the latter is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself,&nbsp;</em>what it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ought to be,&nbsp;</em>but this ought-to-be is at the same time reflected into itself, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">realised;&nbsp;</em>it is a purely self-related, wholly affirmative being. In infinity we have the satisfaction that all determinateness, alteration, all limitation and with it the ought itself, are posited as vanished, as sublated, that the nothing of the finite is posited. As this negation of the finite the in-itself is determinate and thus, as negation of the negation, is affirmative within itself. But this affirmation as qualitative, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate</em>&nbsp;self-relation, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being;&nbsp;</em>and thus the infinite is reduced to the category of a being which has the finite confronting it as an other; its negative nature is posited as the s imply&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affirmative,&nbsp;</em>hence as the first and immediate negation. The infinite is in this way burdened with the opposition to the finite which, as an other, remains at the same time a determinate reality although in its in-itself, in the infinite, it is at the same time posited as sublated; this infinite is the non-finite-a being in the determinateness of negation. Contrasted with the finite, with the sphere of affirmative determinatenesses, of realities, the infinite is the indeterminate void, the beyond of the finite, whose being-in-itself is not present in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>reality.</p>

This negation which connects them &mdash; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">somethings&nbsp;</em>reflected into themselves &mdash; is the limit of the one relatively to the other, and that, too, in such a manner that each of them does not have the limit&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in it&nbsp;</em>merely relatively to the other, but the negation is their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-in-itself</em>; the limit is thus present in each on its own account, in separation from the other. But the limit is in the form of the first negation and thus both are limited, finite in themselves. However, each as affirmatively self-related is also the negation of its limit; each thus immediately repels the limit, as its non-being, from itself and, as qualitatively separated from it, posits it as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another being&nbsp;</em>outside it, the finite positing its non-being as this infinite and the infinite, similarly, the finite. It is readily conceded that there is a necessary transition from the finite to the infinite &mdash; necessary through the determination of the finite &mdash; and that the finite is raised to the form of being-in-itself, since the finite, although persisting as a determinate being, is at the same time also determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>&nbsp;nothing and therefore as destined to bring about its own dissolution; whereas the infinite, although determined as burdened with negation and limit, is at the same time also determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">possessing being-in-itself,&nbsp;</em>so that this abstraction of self-related affirmation constitutes its determination, and hence finite determinate being is not present in it. But it has been shown that the infinite itself attains affirmative being only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">by means of</em>negation, as the negation of negation, and that when this its affirmation is taken as merely simple, qualitative being, the negation contained in it is reduced to a simple immediate negation and thus to a determinateness and limit, which then, as in contradiction with the being-in-itself of the infinite is posited as excluded from it, as not belonging to it, as, on the contrary, opposed to its being-in-itself, as the finite. As therefore each is in its own self and through its own determination the positing of its other, they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inseparable.&nbsp;</em>But this their unity is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concealed&nbsp;</em>in their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative&nbsp;</em>otherness, it is the inner unity which only lies at their base.</p>

We pass from the finite to the infinite. This transcending of the finite appears as an external act. In this void beyond the finite, what arises? What is the positive element in it? Owing to the inseparability of the infinite and the finite &mdash; or because this infinite remaining aloof on its own side is itself limited &mdash; there arises a limit; the infinite has vanished and its other, the finite, has entered. But this entrance of the finite appears as a happening external to the infinite, and the new limit as something that does not arise from the infinite itself but is likewise found as given. And so we are faced with a relapse into the previous determination which has been sublated in vain. But this new limit is itself only something which has to be sublated or transcended. And so again there arises the void, the nothing, in which similarly the said determinateness, a new limit, is encountered &mdash; and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">so on to infinity.</em></p>

Since now they must also be distinguished, each is, as has just been shown, in its own self the unity of both; thus we have two such unities. The common element, the unity of the two determinatenesses, as unity, posits them in the first place as negated, since each is supposed to be what it is in its distinction from the other; in their unity, therefore, they lose their qualitative nature-an important reflection for rebutting that idea of the unity which insists on holding fast to the infinite and finite in the quality they are supposed to have when taken in their separation from each other, a view which therefore sees in that unity only contradiction, but not also resolution of the contradiction through the negation of the qualitative determinateness of both; thus the unity of the infinite and finite, simple and general in the first instance, is falsified.</p>

Here too this results from taking the infinite in one of the two unities not as negated, but rather as the in-itself, in which, therefore, determinateness and limitation are not to be explicitly present, for these would debase and ruin it. Conversely, the finite is likewise held fast as not negated, although in itself it is null; so that in its union with the infinite it is exalted to what it is not and is thereby infinitised in opposition to its determination as finite, which instead of vanishing is perpetuated.</p>

Starting from the finite, the limit is transcended, the finite negated. We now have its beyond, the infinite, but in this the limit&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">arises&nbsp;</em>again; and so we have the transcending of the infinite. This double sublation, however, is partly only an external affair, an alternation of the moments, and partly it is not yet posited as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">single unity;&nbsp;</em>the transcending of each moment starts independently, is a fresh act, so that the two processes fall apart. But in addition there is also present in the infinite progress their<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">connection.&nbsp;</em>First there is the finite, then this is transcended and this negative or beyond of the finite is the infinite, and then this negation is again transcended, so that there arises a new limit, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finite&nbsp;</em>again. This is the complete, self-closing movement which has arrived at that which constituted the beginning; what arises is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">same&nbsp;</em>as that from which the movement&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">began</em>&nbsp;that is, the finite is restored; it has therefore united&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with itself,&nbsp;</em>has in its beyond only found&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">itself&nbsp;</em>again.</p>

In the infinite, the beyond of the limit, there arises only another limit which has the same fate, namely, that as finite it must be negated. Thus what is present again is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">same&nbsp;</em>infinite which had previously disappeared in the new limit; the infinite, therefore, through its sublating, through its transcending of the new limit, is not removed any further either from the finite-for the finite is only this, to pass over into the infinite-or from itself, for it has arrived&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">at&nbsp;</em>its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">own self.</em></p>

It is, however, a matter of complete indifference which is taken as the beginning; and thus the difference which occasioned the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">double&nbsp;</em>result disappears of itself. This is likewise explicit in the line &mdash; unending in both directions &mdash; of the infinite progress in which each of the moments presents itself in equal alternation, and it is quite immaterial what point is fixed on or which of the two is taken as the beginning. They are distinguished in it but each is equally only the moment of the other. Since both the finite and the infinite itself are moments of the progress they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">jointly or in common the finite,</em>and since they are equally together negated in it and in the result, this result as negation of the finitude of both is called with truth the infinite. Their difference is thus the double meaning which both have. The finite has the double meaning of being first, only the finite<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">over against the</em>&nbsp;infinite which stands opposed to it, and secondly, of being the finite and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">at the same time&nbsp;</em>the infinite opposed to it. The infinite, too, has the double meaning of being one of these two moments &mdash; as such it is the spurious infinite &mdash; and also the infinite in which both, the infinite and its other, are only moments. The infinite, therefore, as now before us is, in fact, the process in which it is deposed to being only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one&nbsp;</em>of its determinations, the opposite of the finite, and so to being itself only one of the finites, and then raising this its difference from itself into the affirmation of itself and through this mediation becoming the true infinite.</p>

It is not the finite which is the real, but the infinite. Thus reality is further determined as essence, Notion, Idea, and so on. It is, however, superfluous to repeat an earlier, more abstract category such as reality, in connection with the more concrete categories and to employ it for determinations which are more concrete than it is in its own self. Such repetition as to say that essence, or the Idea, is the real, has its origin in the fact that for untrained thinking, the most abstract categories such as being, determinate being, reality, finitude, are the most familiar.</p>

The negation is thus determined as ideality; ideal being [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">das Ideelle</em>] is the finite as it is in the true infinite &mdash; as a determination, a content, which is distinct but is not an<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">independent, self-subsistent&nbsp;</em>being, but only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moment.</em></p>

With reference to reality and ideality, however, the opposition of finite and infinite is grasped in such a manner that the finite ranks as the real but the infinite as the &#39;ideal&#39; [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">das Ideelle</em>]; in the same way that further on the Notion, too, is regarded as an &#39;ideal&#39;, that is, as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mere</em>&nbsp;&#39;ideal&#39;, in contrast to determinate being as such which is regarded as the real. When they are contrasted in this way, it is pointless to reserve the term &#39;ideal&#39; for the concrete determination of negation in question; in that opposition we return once more to the one-sidedness of the abstract negative which is characteristic of the spurious infinite, and perpetuate the affirmative determinate being of the finite.</p>

Thus, in the causal relation, cause and effect are inseparable; a cause which had no effect would not be a cause, just as an effect which had no cause would no longer be an effect. This relation yields, therefore, the infinite progress of causes and effects; something is determined as cause, but as finite (and it is finite for the very reason that it is separated from its effect) it, too, has a cause, that is, it is also an effect; hence the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">same thing&nbsp;</em>that was determined as cause is also determined as effect &mdash; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>of cause and effect; now that which is determined as effect again has a cause, that is, the cause has to be separated from its effect and posited as a different something; but this fresh cause is itself only an effect &mdash; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>of cause and effect; it has an other for its cause &mdash; the separation of both determinations, and so on to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinity.</em></p>

The assertion is made: the finite and infinite are a single unity; this false assertion must be corrected by the opposite: they are absolutely different and opposed to each other; this must be corrected again by declaring that they are inseparable, that the determination of each lies in the other, by the assertion of their unity, and so on to infinity. What is required in order to see into the nature of the infinite is nothing difficult: it is to be aware that the infinite progress, the developed infinite of the understanding, is so constituted as to be the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alternation&nbsp;</em>of the two determinations, of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>and the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">separation&nbsp;</em>of both moments and also to be aware that this unity and this separation are themselves inseparable.</p>

In this being which is thus the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideality of</em>&nbsp;the distinct moments, the contradiction has not vanished abstractly, but is resolved and reconciled, and the thoughts are not only complete, but they are also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">brought together.&nbsp;</em>In this detailed example, there is revealed the specific nature of speculative thought, which consists solely in grasping the opposed moments in their unity. Each moment actually shows that it contains its opposite within itself and that in this opposite it is united with itself; thus the affirmative truth is this immanently active unity, the taking together of both thoughts, their infinity &mdash; the relation to self which is not immediate but infinite.</p>

Being, it is true, is itself the indeterminate; but that it is the opposite of determinate being, this is not directly expressed in it.

The answer, therefore, to the question: how does the infinite become finite? is this: that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">there is not&nbsp;</em>an infinite which is first of all infinite and only subsequently has need to become finite, to go forth into finitude; on the contrary, it is on its own account just as much finite as infinite. The question assumes that the infinite, on the one side, exists by itself, and that the finite which has gone forth from it into a separate existence &mdash; or from whatever source it might have come &mdash; is in its separation from the infinite truly real; but it should rather be said that this separation is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">incomprehensible.&nbsp;</em>Neither such a finite nor such an infinite has truth; and what is untrue is incomprehensible. But equally it must be said that they are comprehensible, to grasp them even as they are in ordinary conception, to see that in the one there lies the determination of the other, the simple insight into their inseparability, means to comprehend them;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this inseparability is their Notion.&nbsp;</em>But the separate self-subsistence of the said infinite and finite assumed in the question is an untrue content, and the question already implies an untrue connection between them. Instead, therefore, of answering the question, we must deny the false presuppositions contained in it, that is, the question itself. The question as to the truth of the said infinite and finite involves a change of standpoint and this change will cause a recoil upon the first question of the embarrassment it was intended to produce. This question of ours is something new for the reflection which is the source of the first question, since such reflection does not contain the speculative interest which, for its own sake and before it connects determinations, sets out to ascertain whether these, as presupposed, are something true. But in so far as the falsity of that abstract infinite, and of the finite which equally is supposed to remain standing on&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its</em>&nbsp;side, is recognised, there is this to be said about the coming or going forth of the finite from the infinite: the infinite goes forth&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">out&nbsp;</em>of itself into finitude because, being grasped as an abstract unity, it has no truth, no enduring being within it; and conversely the finite goes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">into&nbsp;</em>the infinite for the same reason, namely that it is a nullity. Or rather it should be said that the infinite has eternally gone forth into finitude, that, solely by itself and without having its other present&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within it,&nbsp;</em>the infinite no more is than pure&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>is.</p>

But if the former is taken, not as the abstract indeterminate unity but, as it already is in the presupposition, as the determinate unity of the finite and the infinite, then the differentiation of both is already present in it too &mdash; a differentiation which is thus at the same time not a releasing of them into a separate self-subsistence, but which leaves them as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideal&nbsp;</em>moments in the unity.

The idealism of philosophy consists in nothing else than in recognising that the finite has no veritable being. Every philosophy is essentially an idealism or at least has idealism for its principle, and the question then is only how far this principle is actually carried out. This is as true of philosophy as of religion; for religion equally does not recognise finitude as a veritable being, as something ultimate and absolute or as something underived, uncreated, eternal. Consequently the opposition of idealistic and realistic philosophy has no significance. A philosophy which ascribed veritable, ultimate, absolute being to finite existence as such, would not deserve the name of philosophy; the principles of ancient or modern philosophies, water, or matter, or atoms are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thoughts,&nbsp;</em>universals, ideal entities, not things as they immediately present themselves to us, that is, in their sensuous individuality &mdash; not even the water of Thales. For although this is also empirical water, it is at the same time also the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself or essence&nbsp;</em>of all other things, too, and these other things are not self-subsistent or grounded in themselves, but are<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>by, are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">derived&nbsp;</em>from, an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other,&nbsp;</em>from water, that is they are ideal entities. Now above we have named the principle or the universal the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideal&nbsp;</em>(and still more must the Notion, the Idea, spirit be so named); and then again we have described individual, sensuous things as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideal&nbsp;</em>in principle, or in their Notion, still more in spirit, that is, as sublated; here we must note, in passing, this twofold aspect which showed itself in connection with the infinite, namely that on the one hand the ideal is concrete, veritable being, and on the other hand the moments of this concrete being are no less ideal &mdash; are sublated in it; but in fact what is, is only the one concrete whole from which the moments are inseparable.</p>

In point of fact, the spirit is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">idealist&nbsp;</em>proper; in spirit, even as feeling, imagination and still more as thinking and comprehending, the content is not present as a so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">real existence;&nbsp;</em>in the simplicity of the ego such external being is present only as sublated, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for me,&nbsp;</em>it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideally&nbsp;</em>in me. This subjective idealism, either in the form of the unconscious idealism of consciousness generally, or consciously enunciated and set up as a principle, concerns only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form</em>&nbsp;of conception according to which a content is mine; in the systematic idealism of subjectivity this form is declared to be the only true exclusive form in opposition to the form of objectivity or reality, of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external existence&nbsp;</em>of that content. Such idealism is [merely] formal because it disregards the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content&nbsp;</em>of imagination or thought, which content in being imagined or thought can remain wholly in its finitude. In such an idealism nothing is lost, just as much because the reality of such a finite content, the existence filled with finitude, is preserved, as because, in so far as abstraction is made from such finite reality, the content is supposed to be of no consequence&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself;&nbsp;</em>and in it nothing is gained for the same reason that nothing is lost, because the ego, conception, spirit, remains filled with the same content of finitude. The opposition of the form of subjectivity and objectivity is of course one of the finitudes; but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content,&nbsp;</em>as taken up in sensation, intuition or even in the more abstract element of conception, of thought, contains finitudes in abundance and with the exclusion of only one of the modes of finitude, namely, of the said form of subjective and objective, these finitudes are certainly not eliminated, still less have they spontaneously fallen away.</p>

It thus contains, to begin with, only the first negation, which is itself immediate; it is true that being, too, is preserved in it and both are united in determinate being in a simple unity, but for that very reason they are in themselves still unequal to each other and their unity is not yet&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited.&nbsp;</em>Determinate being is therefore the sphere of difference, of dualism, the field of finitude. Determinateness is determinateness as such, in which being is only relatively, not absolutely determined. In being-for-self, the difference between being and determinateness or negation is posited and equalised; quality, otherness, limit &mdash; like reality, being-in-itself, the ought, and so on-are the imperfect embodiments of the negation in being in which the difference of both still lies at the base. Since, however, in finitude the negation has passed into infinity, into the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>negation of negation, it is simple self-relation and consequently in its own self the equalisation with being,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolutely determined being.</em></p>

All that is now necessary to justify our use of the term for this Notion is to demonstrate that the said Notion corresponds to the general idea associated with the expression, being-for-self. And so indeed it seems; we say that something is for itself in so far as it transcends otherness, its connection and community with other, has repelled them and made abstraction from them. For it, the other has being only as sublated, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its moment;&nbsp;</em>being-for-self consists in having so transcended limitation, its otherness, that it is, as this negation, the infinite return into itself. Consciousness, even as such, contains in principle the determination of being-for-self in that it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">represents&nbsp;</em>to itself an object which it senses, or intuits, and so forth; that is, it has<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within it&nbsp;</em>the content of the object, which in this manner has an &#39;ideal&#39; being; in its very intuiting and, in general, in its entanglement with the negative of itself, with its other, consciousness is still only in the presence of its own self. Being-for-self is the polemical, negative attitude towards the limiting other, and through this negation of the latter is a reflectedness-into-self, although along with this return of consciousness into itself and the ideality of the object, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reality&nbsp;</em>of the object&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is also&nbsp;</em>still preserved, in that it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">at the same time&nbsp;</em>known as an external existence. Consciousness thus belongs to the sphere of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Appearance,&nbsp;</em>or is the dualism, on the one hand of knowing an alien object external to it, and on the other hand of being for its own self, having the object ideally [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideell</em>] present in it; of being not only in the presence of the other, but therein being in the presence of its own self.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Self-consciousness,&nbsp;</em>on the other hand, is being-for-self as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consummated and posited;&nbsp;</em>the side of connection with an other, with an external object, is removed. Self-consciousness is thus the nearest example of the presence of infinity; granted, of an infinity which is still abstract, yet which, at the same time, is a very different concrete determination from being-for-self in general, the infinity of which has a determinateness which is still quite qualitative.</p>

Thus the determinateness which in determinate being as such is an other, and a being-for-other, is bent back into the infinite unity of being-for-self, and the moment of determinate being is present in being-for-self as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-for-one.</em></p>

In being-for-self, negation is not present as a determinateness or limit, or consequently as a relation to a determinate being which is for it an other. Now though this moment has been designated&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as being-for-one,&nbsp;</em>there is as yet nothing present for which it would be-no one, of which it would be the moment. There is, in fact, nothing of the kind as yet fixed in being-for-self; that for which something (and here there is no something) would be, whatever the other side as such might be, is likewise a moment, is itself only a being-for-one, not yet a one. Consequently, what we have before us is still an undistinguishedness of the two sides which may be suggested by being-for-one; there is only one being- orother, and because there is only one, this too is only a being-for-one; there is only the one ideality of that, for which or in which there is supposed to be a determination as moment, and of that which is supposed to be a moment in it. Being-for-one and being-for-self are, therefore, not genuinely opposed determinatenesses. If the difference is assumed for a moment and we speak of a being-for-self, then it is this itself which, as the sublatedness of otherness, relates itself to itself as the sublated other, and is therefore &#39;for&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one&#39;;&nbsp;</em>it is related in its other only to its own self. Ideal being [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Ideelles</em>] is necessarily &#39;for one&#39;, but it is not for an other; the one for which it is, is only itself. The ego, therefore, spirit as such, or God, are &#39;ideal&#39; because they are infinite; but as being for themselves they are not &#39;ideally&#39; different from that which is &#39;for one&#39;. For if they were, they would be only immediate existences, or, more precisely, determinate being and a being-for-other, because that which would be for them would be, not themselves but an other, if they were supposed to lack the moment of being &#39;for one&#39;. God is, therefore,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for himself&nbsp;</em>in so far as he himself is that which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for him.</em></p>

In this sense self-consciousness, spirit, God, is ideal as an infinite relation purely to self.

As to the manner in which it is carried through, a further observation may be made in connection with the category we have reached. This carrying through of the principle depends primarily on whether the finite reality still retains an independent self-subsistence alongside the being-for-self, but also on whether in the infinite itself the moment&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of being-for-one,&nbsp;</em>a relationship of the ideal to itself as ideal, is posited. Thus the Eleatic Being or Spinoza&#39;s substance is only the abstract negation of all determinateness, without ideality being posited in substance itself. With Spinoza, as will be mentioned later, infinity is only the absolute<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affirmation&nbsp;</em>of a thing, hence only the unmoved unity; consequently, substance does not even reach the determination of being-for-self, much less that of subject and spirit. The idealism of the noble Malebranche is in itself more explicit. It contains the following fundamental thoughts: because God includes within himself all eternal truths, the ideas and perfections of all things, so that they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">his</em>and his alone, we see them only in him; God awakens in us our sensations of objects by an action in which there is nothing sensuous, whereby we imagine to ourselves that we obtain not only the idea of the object which represents its essential nature, but also the sensation of its existence. As then the eternal truths and Ideas (essentialities) of things are in God, are ideal, so also is their existence in God ideal, not an actual existence; though they are our objects, they are only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for one.&nbsp;</em>This moment of explicit and concrete idealism which is lacking in Spinozism is present here, in that absolute ideality is characterised as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">knowing.&nbsp;</em>Pure and profound as this idealism is, the above relations on the one hand still contain much that is indeterminate for thought and, on the other hand, their content is directly quite concrete (sin and salvation, etc., enter directly into them); the logical determination of infinity on which they would have to be based is not explicitly realised, and thus this lofty and rich idealism, though it is the product of a pure, speculative spirit, is still not the product of a pure, speculative thinking which alone can truly establish it.</p>

The ideating being, the monad, of Leibniz is essentially ideal [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Ideelles</em>]. Ideation is a being-for-self in which the determinatenesses are not limits, and consequently not a determinate being, but only moments. Ideation is also, it is true, a more concrete determination, but here it has no further signification than that of ideality; for with Leibniz, even that which lacks consciousness is an ideating, percipient being. In this system, then, otherness is sublated; spirit and body, or the monads generally, are not others for one another, they do not limit one another and do not affect one another; all relationships generally which are based on a determinate being fall away. The diversity is only ideal and inner and in it the monad remains related only to itself; the alterations develop within the monad and are not relations of it to others. What is taken to be, in accordance with the real determination, a determinately existent relation of the monads to one another, is an independent, only<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simultaneous becoming,&nbsp;</em>enclosed within the being-for-self of each of them. That there is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plurality of monads,&nbsp;</em>that therefore they are also determined as others, does not concern the monads themselves; this is the reflection, external to them &#39; of a third. They are not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in themselves others to one another;&nbsp;</em>the being-for-self is kept pure, and is free from the accompaniment of any real being. But herein lies, too, the inadequacy of this system. The monads are such ideating, percipient beings only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in themselves, or in God&nbsp;</em>as the monad of monads, or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">even in the system.&nbsp;</em>Otherness is equally present, whether in the ideation itself or in whatever shape the third assumes which considers them as others, as a plurality. The plurality of their determinate being is only excluded, and that only momentarily, the monads being posited as not-others only by abstraction. If it is a third which posits their otherness, it is also a third which sublates it; but this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">entire movement which gives them their ideality&nbsp;</em>falls outside them. Should it be pointed out that this movement of thought itself falls, nevertheless, only within an ideating monad, the reply must be that the very&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content</em>&nbsp;of such thinking is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within itself external to itself</em>. The transition from the oneness of absolute ideality (the monad of monads) to the category of the abstract (connectionless)<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plurality&nbsp;</em>of determinate being, is immediate and uncomprehended (it is effected through the image of creation); and the transition from this plurality back to the oneness is equally abstract. Ideality, ideation generally, remains something formal, as also does ideation raised to the form of consciousness. just as consciousness is conceived as a one-sided form which is indifferent to its determination and content, in the above-mentioned fancy of Leibniz &mdash; namely, that the magnetic needle, if it possessed consciousness, would regard its direction to the north as freely determined by itself &mdash; so, too, ideality in the monads is a form remaining external to the plurality. Ideality is supposed to be immanent in them, their nature is supposed to be ideation; but their relationship is on the one hand their harmony, which does not fall within the sphere of their determinate being and is, consequently, pre-established; and on the other hand, this determinate being of theirs is not grasped as a being-for-other, or, further, as ideality, but is determined only as an abstract plurality; the ideality of the plurality and the further determination of it to harmony are not immanent in and proper to this plurality itself.</p>

The abstraction which has developed into this form has acquired a greater determinateness than the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>of Parmenides and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming&nbsp;</em>of Heraclitus. Lofty as is this abstraction, in that it makes this simple determinateness of the one and the void the principle of all things, deriving the infinite variety of the world from this simple antithesis and boldly presuming to know the former from the latter, it is equally easy for figurate conception to picture here atoms and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alongside&nbsp;</em>them the void. It is, therefore, no wonder that the atomistic principle has at all times been upheld; the equally trivial and external relation of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">composition</em>&nbsp;which must be added to achieve a semblance of concreteness and variety is no less popular than the atoms themselves and the void. The one and the void is being-for-self, the highest qualitative being-within-self, sunk back into complete&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality; the</em>&nbsp;immediacy or being of the one, because it is the negation of all otherness, is posited as being no longer determinable and alterable; such therefore is its absolute, unyielding rigidity that all determination, variety, conjunction remains for it an utterly external relation.</p>

That the void is the source of movement has not the trivial meaning that something can only move into an empty space and not into an already occupied space, for in such a space it would not find any more open room &mdash; understood in this sense, the void would be only the presupposition or condition of movement, not its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground,&nbsp;</em>just as the movement itself, too, would be presupposed as already existing, the essential point, its ground, being forgotten. The view that the void constitutes the ground of movement contains the profounder thought that in the negative as such there lies the ground of becoming, of the unrest of self-movement &mdash; in which sense, however, the negative is to be taken as the veritable negativity of the infinite. The void is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground&nbsp;</em>of movement only as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative&nbsp;</em>relation of the one to its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative,&nbsp;</em>to the one, that is to itself, which however is posited as having determinate being.</p>

Physics with its molecules and particles suffers from the atom, this principle of extreme externality, which is thus utterly devoid of the Notion, just as much as does that theory of the State which starts from the particular will of individuals.</p>

We may add here that this idealism which started from the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideating monad,</em>which is determined as being for itself, advanced only as far as the repulsion just considered, and indeed only to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plurality as</em>&nbsp;such, in which each of the ones is only for its own self and is indifferent to the determinate being and being-for-self of the others; or, in general, for the one, there are no others at all. The monad is, by itself, the entire closed universe; it requires none of the others. But this inner manifoldness which it possesses in its ideational activity in no way affects its character as a being-for-self. The Leibnizian idealism takes up the plurality immediately as something given and does not grasp it as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">repulsion&nbsp;</em>of the monads. Consequently, it possesses plurality only on the side of its abstract externality. The atomistic philosophy does not possess the Notion of ideality; it does not grasp the one as an ideal being, that is, as containing&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within itself&nbsp;</em>the two moments of being-forself and being-for-it, but only as a simple, dry, real being-for-self. It does, however, go beyond mere indifferent plurality; the atoms become further determined in regard to one another even though, strictly speaking, this involves an inconsistency; whereas, on the contrary, in that indifferent independence of the monads, plurality remains as a fixed&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fundamental determination,&nbsp;</em>so that the connection between them falls only in the monad of monads, or in the philosopher who contemplates them.</p>

But they are only in so far as they negate; consequently, since this their negating is negated, their being is negated. It is true that since they are, they would not be negated by this negating, which for them is only something external; this negating by the other rebounds off them and touches only their surface. And yet it is only through this negating of the others that the ones return into themselves: they are only as this mediation, and this their return is their self-preservation and their being-for-self. Since their negating is ineffectual because of the resistance offered by the ones either as simply affirmative or as negating, they do not return into themselves, do not preserve themselves, and so are not.</p>

It is the supreme, most stubborn error, which takes itself for the highest truth, manifesting in more concrete forms as abstract freedom, pure ego and, further, as Evil. It is that freedom which so misapprehends itself as to place its essence in this abstraction, and flatters itself that in thus being with itself it possesses itself in its purity. More specifically, this self-subsistence is the error of regarding as negative that which is its own essence, and of adopting a negative attitude towards it. Thus it is the negative attitude towards itself which, in seeking to possess its own being destroys it, and this its act is only the manifestation of the futility of this act. The reconciliation is the recognition that the object of this negative attitude is rather its own essence, and is only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">letting go&nbsp;</em>of the negativity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of its&nbsp;</em>being-for-self instead of holding fast to it.</p>

We may repeat here the observation that the truth of the one and the many expressed in propositions appears in an inappropriate form, that this truth is to be grasped and expressed only as a becoming, as a process, a repulsion and attraction-not as being, which in a proposition has the character of a stable unity. We have already mentioned and recalled the dialectic of Plato in the Parmenides concerning the derivation of the many from the one, namely, from the proposition: the one is. The inner dialectic of the Notion has been stated; it is easiest to grasp the dialectic of the proposition, that the many are one, as an external reflection; and it may properly be grasped externally here inasmuch as the object too, the many, are mutually external. It directly follows from this comparison of the many with one another that any one is determined simply like any other one; each is a one, each is one of the many,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>by excluding the others &mdash; so that they are absolutely the same, there is present one and only one determination. This is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fact,&nbsp;</em>and all that has to be done is to grasp this simple fact. The only reason why the understanding stubbornly refuses to do so is that it has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">also&nbsp;</em>in mind, and indeed rightly so, the difference; but the existence of this difference is just as little excluded because of the said fact, as is the certain existence of the said fact in spite of the difference. One could, as it were, comfort understanding for the naive manner in which it grasps the fact of the difference, by assuring it that the difference will also come in again.</p>

In attraction, however, ideality is realised. Repulsion passes over into attraction, the many ones into one one. Both repulsion and attraction are in the first place distinct from each other, the former as the reality of the ones, the latter as their posited ideality. The relation of attraction to repulsion is such that the former has the latter<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for presupposition.&nbsp;</em>Repulsion provides the material for attraction. If there were no ones there would be nothing to attract; the conception of a perpetual attraction, of an absorption of the ones, presupposes an equally perpetual production of them. Spatial attraction as pictorially conceived makes the flow of attracted ones proceed uninterruptedly; in place of the atoms which vanish in the centre of attraction, another multitude comes forth from the void, and so on to infinity if one wishes. If attraction were conceived as accomplished, the many being brought to the point of the one one, then there would be present only an inert one and no longer any attraction. The ideality present in attraction still also bears within itself the determination of the negation of itself, the many ones of which it is the relatedness: attraction is inseparable from repulsion.</p>

But there can be no question here of a precedence of such a one over another, for this would presuppose a specific difference between them; rather is attraction the positing of the immediately present undifferentiatedness of the ones. It is only attraction itself that is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positing&nbsp;</em>of a one distinct from other ones; these are only immediate ones which should maintain themselves through repulsion; but through their posited negation arises the one of attraction, which is consequently determined as mediated, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one posited as one.&nbsp;</em>The first ones, as immediate, do not in their ideality return into themselves but have this ideality in another one.</p>

The<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-presupposing&nbsp;</em>as such is the one&#39;s positing of itself in a one as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative&nbsp;</em>of itself-repulsion; and what is therein presupposed is<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the same&nbsp;</em>as that which presupposes-attraction. That each is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>only a moment, is the transition of each out of itself into the other, the self-negating of each in itself and the self-positing of each as its own other. The one as such, then, is a coming-out-of-itself, is only the positing of itself as its own other, as many; and the many, similarly, is only this, to collapse within itself and to posit itself as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its</em>other, as one, and in this very act to be related only to its own self, each continuing itself in its other. Thus there is already present in principle (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an sich</em>) the undividedness of the coming-out-of-itself (repulsion) and the self-positing as one (attraction). But in the relative repulsion and attraction, which presuppose immediate,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinates&nbsp;</em>existent ones, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>that each is in its own self this negation of itself and is thus also the continuity of itself in its other. The repulsion of the determinately existent ones is the self-preservation of the one through the mutual repulsion of the others, so that&nbsp;<span class="point1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">(1)</span>&nbsp;the other ones are negated in it-this is the side of its determinate being or of its being-for-other; but this is thus attraction as the ideality of the ones; and&nbsp;<span class="point1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">(2)</span>&nbsp;the one is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>, without relation to the others; but not only has being-in-itself as such long since passed over into being-for-self, but the one&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>, by its determination, is the aforesaid becoming of many ones. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">attraction</em>&nbsp;of the determinately existent ones is their ideality and the positing of the one, in which, accordingly, attraction as a negating and a generating of the one sublates itself, and as a positing of the one is in its own self the negative of itself, repulsion.</p>

Further, they are imagined as meeting in a third, in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">matter</em>, but in such a manner, that this unification is, counted, as their truth., on the contrary; each is regarded also as a first, as being in and for itself, and matter, or its determinations, are supposed to be realised and produced by them.

He presupposes the idea of matter and then asks what forces are required to maintain the determinations he has presupposed. Thus, on the one hand, he demands the force of attraction because, properly speaking, through repulsion alone and without attraction matter could not exist; and on the other hand he derives repulsion, too, from matter and gives as the reason that we think of matter as impenetrable, since it presents itself under this category to the sense of touch by which it manifests itself to us. Consequently, he proceeds, repulsion is at once thought in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concept&nbsp;</em>of matter because it is immediately given therein, whereas attraction is added to the concept&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">syllogistically.&nbsp;</em>But these syllogisms, too, are based on what has just been said, namely, that matter which possessed repulsive force alone, would not exhaust our conception of matter.</p>

But if, further, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existence&nbsp;</em>of matter is supposed to be impossible without attraction, then this assertion is based on a conception of matter taken from sense perception; consequently, the determination of attraction, too, must come within the range of sense perception. It is indeed easy to perceive that matter, besides its being-for-self, which sublates the being-for-other (offers resistance), has also a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>between its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self</em>-<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determined parts,&nbsp;</em>a spatial<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">extension and cohesion,&nbsp;</em>and in rigidity and solidity the cohesion is very firm. Physics explains that the tearing apart, etc., of a body requires a force which shall be stronger than the mutual&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">attraction&nbsp;</em>of the parts of the body. From this observation reflection can just as directly derive the force of attraction or assume it as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">given,&nbsp;</em>as it did with the force of repulsion. In point of fact, if we consider Kant&#39;s arguments from which the force of attraction is supposed to be deduced (the proof of the proposition that the possibility of matter requires a force of attraction as a second fundamental force,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">loc. cit.),&nbsp;</em>it is apparent that their sole content is this, that through repulsion alone matter would not be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">spatial&nbsp;</em>Matter being presupposed as filling space, it is credited with continuity, the ground of which is assumed to be the force of attraction.</p>

Kant is chiefly concerned to banish the vulgar mechanistic way of thinking which stops short at the one determination of impenetrability, of self-determined and self-subsistent puncticity, and converts into something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>the opposite determination, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation of</em>&nbsp;matter within itself or the relation of a plurality of matters, which in turn are regarded as particular ones &mdash; a way of thinking which, as Kant says, will admit no motive forces except pressure and thrust, that is, only action from without. This<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>manner of thinking always presupposes motion as already externally&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">present</em>&nbsp;in matter, and it does not occur to it to regard motion as something immanent and to comprehend motion itself in matter, which latter is thus assumed as, on its own account, motionless and inert. This stand-point has before it only ordinary mechanics, not immanent and free motion. It is true that Kant sublates this externality in so far as he makes attraction (the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of matters to one another in so far as these are assumed as separated from one another, or matter generally in its self-externality) a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">force of matter itself</em>; still, on the other hand, his two fundamental forces within matter remain external to and completely independent of each other.</p>

The reason adduced that the latter can be only a surface force is as follows: &lsquo;The parts in<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contact&nbsp;</em>each limit the sphere of action of the other, and the force of repulsion cannot move any more distant part except through the agency of the intervening parts; an immediate action of one part of matter on another passing right across these intervening parts by forces of expansion (which means here, forces of repulsion) is impossible.&rsquo;</p>

Further, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">genuine penetration&nbsp;</em>of the force of attraction could of necessity consist only in this, that every part of matter was in and for itself attractive, not that a certain number of atoms behaved passively and only one atom actively. But we must at once remark with respect to the force of repulsion itself that in the passage quoted, &#39;parts in contact&#39; are mentioned which implies&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">solidity and continuity&nbsp;</em>of a matter already&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finished and complete&nbsp;</em>which would not permit the passage through it of a repelling force. But this solidity of matter in which parts are in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contact&nbsp;</em>and are no longer separated by the void already presupposes that the force of repulsion is sublated; according to the sensuous conception of repulsion which prevails here, parts in contact are to be taken as those which do not repel each other. It therefore follows, quite tautologically, that where repulsion is assumed to be not, there no repulsion can take place. But from this nothing else follows which could serve to determine the force of repulsion. However, reflection on the statement that parts in contact are in contact only in so far as they hold themselves apart, leads directly to the conclusion that the force of repulsion is not merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">on the surface&nbsp;</em>of matter but within the sphere which was supposed to be only a sphere of attraction.</p>

This distinction is much the same as the one mentioned above where a determination was supposed to belong to the concept of a thing but not to be contained in it; here, then, matter is supposed only to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">occupy&nbsp;</em>a space but not to fill it. There it is repulsion, if we stop at the first determination of matter, through which the ones repel one another and so are only negatively related to one another, here that means, by empty space. Here, however, it is the force of attraction which keeps space empty; it does not fill space by its connection of the atoms, in other words, it keeps the atoms in a negative relation to one another. We see that Kant here unconsciously realises what is implicit in the nature of the subject matter, when he attributes to the force of attraction precisely what, in accordance with the first determination, he attributed to the opposite force. While he was busy with establishing the difference between the two forces, it happened that one had passed over into the other. Thus through repulsion, on the other hand, matter is supposed to fill a space, and consequently through repulsion the empty space left by the force of attraction vanishes. In point of fact repulsion, in doing away with empty space, also destroys the negative relation of the atoms or ones, that is, their repulsion of one another; in -other words, repulsion is determined as the opposite of itself.</p>

In the definition of surface and penetrative force both are assumed as motive forces by means of which matter is supposed to be able to act in one or other of these ways. Here, therefore, they are represented as forces, not through which matter first comes into being but through which matter, as an already finished product, is only set in motion. But in so far as we are speaking of the forces through which different bodies act on one another and are set in motion, this is something quite different from the determination and relation which these forces were supposed to have as [constitutive] moments of matter.</p>

These appear to offer an essential distinction, since in their sphere there is a fixed single one, a centre, in relation to which the other ones behave as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not for themselves,&nbsp;</em>so that the difference between the forces can be linked to this presupposed difference between a single central one and the others which are not independent relatively to it. But if they are to be used for explanation &mdash; for which purpose they are assumed to be (like the forces of repulsion and attraction) in an inverse quantitative ratio so that the one increases as the other decreases &mdash; then the phenomenon of the motion and its inequality ought to be the result of these forces which were assumed for the purpose of explanation. However, one need only examine the accounts (any of them will do) of a phenomenon like the unequal velocity of a planet in its orbit round the sun, based on the opposition of these forces, to become aware of the confusion which prevails in such explanations, and the impossibility of disentangling the magnitudes of the forces, so that the one which in the explanation is assumed to be decreasing can just as well be assumed to be increasing, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vice versa</em>. To make this evident would require a lengthier exposition than could be given here; but what is necessary for this purpose is adduced later on in connection with the inverted relation.</p>

If, however, by limit we mean quantitative limit, then when, for example, a field alters its limit it still remains what it was before, a field. If on the other hand its qualitative limit is altered, then since this is the determinateness which makes it a field, it becomes a meadow, wood, and so on. A red, whether brighter or paler, is still red; but if it altered its quality it would cease to be red, would become blue or some other colour. The determination of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">magnitude&nbsp;</em>as quantum reached above, namely that it has a permanent substratum of being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">which is indifferent to its determinateness,&nbsp;</em>can be found in any other example.</p>

A magnitude is usually defined as that which can be increased or diminished. But to increase means to make the magnitude more, to decrease, to make the magnitude less. In this there lies a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference&nbsp;</em>of magnitude as such from itself and magnitude would thus be that of which the magnitude can be altered. The definition thus proves itself to be inept in so far as the same term is used in it which was to have been defined. Since the same term must not be used in the definition, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more and less&nbsp;</em>can be resolved into an affirmative addition which, in accordance with the nature of quantum, is likewise external, and a subtraction, as an equally external negation. It is this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>form both of reality and of negation which in general characterises the nature of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alteration&nbsp;</em>in quantum. In that imperfect expression, therefore, one cannot fail to recognise the main point involved, namely the indifference of the alteration, so that the alteration&#39;s own&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">less,&nbsp;</em>its indifference to itself, lies in its very Notion.</p>

The absolute brittleness of the repelling one has melted away into this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>which, however, as containing this one, is at the same time determined by the immanent repulsion, and as unity of the self-externality is unity with itself. Attraction is in this way the moment of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuity&nbsp;</em>in quantity.</p>

In continuity, the plurality is posited as it is in itself; the many are all alike, each is the same as the other and the plurality is, consequently, a simple, undifferentiated sameness. Continuity is this moment of self-sameness of the asunderness, the self-continuation of the different ones into those from which they are distinguished.</p>

Continuity is self-sameness, but of the Many which, however, do not become exclusive; it is repulsion which expands the selfsameness to continuity. Hence discreteness, on its side, is a coalescent discreteness, where the ones are not connected by the void, by the negative, but by their own continuity and do not interrupt this self-sameness in the many.</p>

Quantity is, as such, this simple result in so far as being-for-self has not yet developed its moments and posited them within itself. It&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contains</em>&nbsp;them to begin with as being-for-self posited as it is in truth. The determination of being-for-self was to be a self-sublating relation-to-self, a perpetual coming-out-of-itself. But what is repelled is itself; repulsion is, therefore, the creative flowing away of itself. On account of the self-sameness of what is repelled, this distinguishing or differentiation is an uninterrupted continuity; and because of the coming-out-of-itself this continuity, without being interrupted, is at the same time a plurality, which no less immediately remains in its self-identicalness.</p>

The presence in it of discreteness as a moment can be expressed by saying that quantity is simply the omnipresent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">real possibility</em>&nbsp;within itself of the one, but conversely that the one is no less absolutely continuous.</p>

But it has been shown that the one essentially and spontaneously (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an und f&uuml;r sich selbst</em>) passes over into attraction, into its ideality, and that consequently continuity is not external to it but belongs to it and is grounded in its very nature. It is just this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality&nbsp;</em>of continuity for the ones to which atomism clings and which ordinary thinking finds it difficult to forsake. Mathematics, on the other hand, rejects a metaphysics which would make time<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consist&nbsp;</em>of points of time; space in general &mdash; or in the first place the line &mdash;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consist</em>&nbsp;of points of space; the plane, of lines; and total space of planes. It allows no validity to such discontinuous ones. Even though, for instance, in determining the magnitude of a plane, it represents it as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum&nbsp;</em>of infinitely many lines, this discreteness counts only as a momentary representation, and the sublation of the discreteness is already implied in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite&nbsp;</em>plurality of the lines, since the space which they are supposed to constitute is after all bounded.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px; text-align: justify;">&#39;Quantity is conceived by us in two manners, to wit, abstractly and superficially, as an offspring of imagination or as a substance, which is done by the intellect alone. If, then, we look at quantity as it is in the imagination, which we often and very easily do, it will be found to be finite, divisible, and composed of parts; but if we look at it as it is in the intellect and conceive it, in so far as it is a substance, which is done with great difficulty, then as we have already sufficiently shown, it will be found to be infinite, without like, and indivisible. This, to all who know how to distinguish between the imagination and the intellect, will be quite clear.&#39;</p>

As regards&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">matter&nbsp;</em>as quantity, among the seven surviving propositions of the first dissertation of Leibniz there is one, the second, which runs:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Non omnino improbabile est, materiam et quantitatem esse realiter idem.&nbsp;</em>In fact, the distinction between these two concepts is simply this, that quantity is a determination of pure thought, whereas matter is the same determination in outer existence. The determination of pure quantity belongs also to the ego which is an absolute becoming-other, an infinite removal or all-round repulsion to the negative freedom of being-for-self which, however, remains utterly simple continuity &mdash; the continuity of universality or being-with-self uninterrupted by the infinitely manifold limits, by the content of sensations, intuitions, and so forth. Those who reject the idea of plurality as a simple unity and besides the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>of it, to wit, that each of the many is the same as every other, namely, a one of the many &mdash; since here we are not speaking of the many as further determined, as green, red, and so on, but of the many considered in and for itself &mdash; demand also a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">representation&nbsp;</em>of this unity, will find plenty of instances in those continua which exhibit the deduced Notion of quantity as present in simple intuition.</p>

But this exposition with all its merits is imperfect; its course is impeded and tangled, and also it is false in regard to its result, which presupposes that cognition has no other forms of thought than finite categories. In both respects these antinomies deserve a more exact critical appraisal which will not only throw more light on their standpoint and method but will also free the main point at issue from the useless form into which it has been forced.</p>

But profounder insight into the antinomial, or more truly into the dialectical nature of reason demonstrates any Notion whatever to be a unity of opposed moments to which, therefore, the form of antinomial assertions could be given. Becoming, determinate being, etc., and any other Notion, could thus provide its particular antinomy, and thus as many antinomies could be constructed as there are Notions.</p>

In order to possess the antinomy in its purity and to deal with it in its simple Notion, the determinations of thought must not be taken in their application to and entanglement in the general idea of the world, of space, time, matter, etc; this concrete material must be omitted from consideration of these determinations which it is powerless to influence and which must be considered purely on their own account since they alone constitute the essence and the ground of the antinomies.</p>

Its genuine solution can only be this: two opposed determinations which belong necessarily to one and the same Notion cannot be valid each on its own in its one-sidedness; on the contrary, they are true only as sublated, only in the unity of their Notion.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px; text-align: justify;">&#39;Every composite substance. in the world consists of simple parts, and nowhere does there exist anything but the simple or what is compounded from it.&#39;</p>

<p class="s" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; color: rgb(31, 0, 95); font-weight: bold; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">&sect; 413</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">To the simple, the atom, there is here opposed the composite, which is a very inferior determination compared to the continuous. The substrate given to these abstractions, namely, substances in the world, here means nothing more than things as sensuously perceived and it has no influence on the antinomy itself; space or time could equally well be taken. Now since the thesis speaks only of composition instead of continuity it is really as it stands an analytical or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">tautological&nbsp;</em>proposition. That the composite is not in its own self a one, but only something externally put together and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consisting of what is other than itself,&nbsp;</em>this is its immediate determination. But the other of the composite is the simple. It is therefore tautological to say that the composite consists of the simple. To ask of what something consists is to ask for an indication of something else, the compounding of which constitutes the said something. If ink is said to consist simply of ink, the meaning of the inquiry after the something else of which it consists has been missed and the question is not answered but only repeated. A further question then is whether that which is under discussion is supposed to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consist of something&nbsp;</em>or not. But the composite is simply that which is supposed to be a combination of something else. If, however, the simple which is the other of the composite is taken only as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relatively&nbsp;</em>simple and is itself composite, too, then the question still remains unanswered. What ordinary thinking has in mind is, perhaps, only some composite or other of which something or other, too, would be assigned as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its&nbsp;</em>simple, such particular something being composite on its own account. But what is under discussion here is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">composite as such.</em></p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px; text-align: justify;">&#39;Assume&#39;, he begins, &#39;that composite substances do not consist of simple parts; then if all composition were thought away no composite part and (since we have just assumed that there are no simple parts) no simple part &mdash; hence nothing at all &mdash; would remain; consequently, no substance would have been given.&#39;</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">This conclusion is quite correct: if nothing but composite substances exist and all that is composite is thought away, then nothing whatever remains; this will be conceded, but this tautological redundance could be omitted and the proof straightway begin with what follows, namely:</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px; text-align: justify;">&#39;Either it is impossible to think away all composition, or else there remains after such removal in thought something which is not composite, that is, the simple.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px; text-align: justify;">&#39;In the first case, however, the composite again would not consist of substances (because with these, composition is only a contingent relation of substances [In addition to the redundance of the proof itself there is here also a redundance of language &#39;because&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with these</em>&#39; (namely the substances) &#39;composition is only a contingent relation of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substances</em>&#39;.] which, apart from such relation, must still persist on their own account). Now since this case contradicts what was assumed, only the second case is left: namely, that all composite substances consist of simple parts.&#39;</p>

The dilemma is this: either the composite persists, or else the simple. If the former, that is, the composite, persists, then what persists would not be substances, for composition is for these only a contingent relation; but substances do persist, therefore, what persists is the simple.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px; text-align: justify;">&#39;composite substance consists of simple parts&#39;, could be directly followed by the reason:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">because&nbsp;</em>composition is merely a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contingent&nbsp;</em>relation of substances, and is therefore external to them and does not concern the substances themselves. If the composition is in fact contingent then, of course, substances are essentially simple. But this contingency which is the sole point at issue is not proved but straightway assumed, and casually, too, in a parenthesis-as something self-evident or of secondary importance. True, it goes without saying that composition is a contingent and external determination; but if the point at issue were only a contingent togetherness instead of continuity, it would not be worth while constructing an antinomy about it &mdash; or rather it would not be possible to formulate one. Therefore, the assertion that the parts are simple is, as remarked, only a tautology.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px; text-align: justify;">Let us assume that substances do not consist of simple parts but are only composite. But now all composition can be thought away (for it is only a contingent relation); after its removal, therefore, there are no substances left unless we assume that they consist of simple parts. But substances we must have for we have assumed them;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">everything&nbsp;</em>is not meant to vanish,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something&nbsp;</em>must be left over, for we have presupposed something persistent which we called substance. Therefore this something must be simple.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px; text-align: justify;">&#39;From this it follows, as a direct consequence, that all things in the world without exception are simple entities, that composition is only an external state of them, and that reason must think the elementary substances as simple entities.&#39;</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">Here we see the externality, that is contingency, of composition put forward as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consequence&nbsp;</em>after it had already been introduced parenthetically and used in the proof.</p>

But the defect of the proof in question is not so much that it is a sophism, as that its laboured, tortuous complexity serves no other purpose than to produce the merely outward semblance of a proof and partially to obscure the quite transparent fact that what was supposed to emerge as a consequence is, parenthetically, that on which the proof hinges; that there is no proof at all, but only an assumption.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px; text-align: justify;">&#39;Suppose&#39;, it runs, &#39;that a composite thing as a substance consists of simple parts. Because all&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>relation, and consequently all composition of substances, is possible only in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">space,</em>&nbsp;therefore, the space occupied by the composite substance must consist of as many parts as those of which the composite substance consists. Now space does not consist of simple parts but of spaces. Therefore each part of the composite substance must occupy a space.&#39;</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px; text-align: justify;">&#39;But the absolutely primary parts of everything composite are simple.&#39;</p>

For it then goes on to conclude that composition is possible only in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">space,&nbsp;</em>that space does not consist of simple parts, and that therefore the real thing occupying a space is composite. But once composition is assumed as an external relation, then spatiality itself (in which alone composition is supposed to be possible) is for that very reason an external relation for the substances, which does not concern them or affect their nature any more than anything else does that can be inferred from the determination of spatiality. For this very reason, the substances ought not to have been put into space.</p>

This Kantian distinction between intuition and concept has, as everyone knows, given rise to a deal of nonsense about the former, and to avoid the labour of comprehension the value and sphere of intuition have been extended to the whole field of cognition. What is pertinent here is just this, that space, and also intuition itself, must be grasped in terms of their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notions&nbsp;</em>if, that is, we want really to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comprehend.&nbsp;</em>And thus the question would arise whether space, even though a simple continuity for intuition, ought not to be grasped, in accordance with its Notion, as consisting of simple parts, or whether it would be involved in the same antinomy which applied only to substance. As a matter of fact, if the antinomy is grasped abstractly, it concerns, as we remarked, quantity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as such,&nbsp;</em>and hence equally space and time.</p>

There is also involved here a clash between the continuity of space and composition; the two are confused with each other, the former being substituted for the latter (which results in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quaternio terminorum&nbsp;</em>in the conclusion). With Kant, space has the express determination of being &#39;sole and single, its parts resting only on limitations, so that they do not precede the one, all-embracing space as, so to speak, its component parts from which it could be compounded.&#39; Here continuity is quite correctly and definitely predicated of space in denial of its composition from parts. On the other hand, in the argument the placing of substances in space is supposed to involve &#39;a manifold of mutually external parts&#39; and, more particularly, &#39;consequently a composite&#39;. Yet, as we have quoted, the way in which manifoldness is present in space is expressly intended to exclude composition and component parts antecedent to the unity of space.</p>

If by substances we are meant here to understand only bodies as we see, touch, taste them, and so on, then we are not really discussing them as they are in their Notion but only as sensuously perceived. The proof of the antithesis, then, amounted in short to this: all our visual, tactile, and other experience shows us only what is composite; even the best microscopes and the keenest knives have not enabled us to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">come across&nbsp;</em>anything simple. Then neither should reason expect to come across anything simple.</p>

When substance, matter, space, time, etc., are taken only as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">discrete,&nbsp;</em>they are absolutely divided; their principle is the one. When they are taken as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous, this</em>&nbsp;one is only a sublated one; division remains a divisibility, it remains the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">possibility&nbsp;</em>of division, as a possibility, without actually reaching the atom. Now even if we stop at the determination given in what has been said about these antitheses, then the moment of the atom is contained in continuity itself, for this is simply the possibility of division; just as said dividedness, discreteness, sublates all distinction of the ones &mdash; for each of the simple ones is what the other is-consequently, also contains their sameness and hence their continuity.</p>

To consider them here, too, would be too lengthy a business; they concern the Notions of space and time and can be dealt with at the same time as these subjects and in the history of philosophy. They reflect the greatest credit on the intelligence of their inventors they have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for result&nbsp;</em>the pure being of Parmenides, in that in them is demonstrated the dissolution of all determinate being; they are thus in themselves the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">flux</em>&nbsp;of Heraclitus. For this reason they deserve a more thorough consideration than the usual explanation that they are just sophisms; which assertion sticks to empirical perception, following the procedure of Diogenes (a procedure which is so illuminating to ordinary common sense) who, when a dialectician pointed out the contradiction contained in motion, made no effort to reason it out but, by silently walking up and down, is supposed to have referred to the evidence of sight for an answer. Such assertion and refutation is certainly easier to make than to engage in thinking and to hold fast and resolve by thought alone the complexities originating in thought, and not in abstruse thought either, but in the thoughts spontaneously arising in ordinary consciousness.</p>

To infinite divisibility (which, being imagined as actually carried out, is the same as infinite dividedness, as the atoms) on which is based the most famous of those proofs, he opposes continuity, which applies equally well to time as to space, so that the infinite, that is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract&nbsp;</em>plurality is contained only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in principle</em>&nbsp;[an sich], as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">possibility,&nbsp;</em>in continuity. What is actual in contrast to abstract plurality as also to abstract continuity, is their concrete forms, space and time themselves, just as these latter are abstract relatively to matter and motion. What is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract&nbsp;</em>has only an implicit or potential being; it only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>as a moment of something real. Bayle, who finds Aristotle&#39;s solution of the Zenonic dialectic &#39;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pitoyable</em>&#39;, does not understand the meaning of the statement that matter is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">potentially&nbsp;</em>infinitely divisible; he rejoins that if matter is infinitely divisible, then it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actually&nbsp;</em>contains an infinite number of parts, that, therefore, this infinite is not an infinite&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">en putssance&nbsp;</em>but an infinite that really and actually exists. On the contrary, divisibility itself even is only a possibility, not an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existing&nbsp;</em>of the parts, and the plurality as such is posited in the continuity only as a moment, as sublated. Acute understanding, in which Aristotle, too, is certainly unsurpassed, is not competent to grasp and to decide on speculative Notions, any more than the crudity of sensuous conception instanced above is adequate to refute the reasoning of Zeno. Such intellect commits the error of holding such mental fictions, such abstractions, as an infinite number of parts, to be something true and actual; but this sensuous consciousness does not let itself be brought beyond the empirical element to thought.</p>

But discrete magnitude is this asunderness as discontinuous, as interrupted. With this plurality of ones, however, we are not again in the presence of the plurality of atoms and the void, repulsion in general. Because discrete magnitude is quantity, its discreteness is itself continuous. This continuity in the discrete consists in the ones being the same as one another, or in having the same unity. Discrete magnitude is, therefore, the asunderness of the manifold one as self-same, not the manifold one in general but posited as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">many of a unity.</em></p>

This, however, is not indifferent to them. In the sphere of determinate being, the relation of the limit to it was primarily such that the determinate being persisted as the affirmative on this side of its limit, while the limit, the negation, was found outside on the border of the determinate being; similarly, the breaking-off [in the counting] of the many ones and the exclusion of other ones appears as a determination falling outside the enclosed ones. But in the qualitative sphere it was found that the limit pervades the determinate being, is coextensive with it, and consequently that it lies in the nature of something to be limited, that is, finite. In the quantitative sphere a number, say a hundred, is conceived in such a manner that the hundredth one alone limits the many to make them a hundred. In one sense this is correct; but on the other hand none of the hundred ones has precedence over any other for they are only equal &mdash; each is equally the hundredth; thus they all belong to the limit which makes the number a hundred and the number cannot dispense with any of them for its determinateness. Hence, relatively to the hundredth one, the others do not constitute a determinate being that is in any way different from the limit, whether they are outside or inside it. Consequently, the number is not a plurality over against the enclosing, limiting one, but itself constitutes this limitation which is a specific quantum; the many constitute a number, a two, a ten, a hundred, and so on.</p>

But this distinguishing does not become a qualitative determinateness but remains quantitative, falling only within the comparing&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external</em>&nbsp;reflection; the number, as a one, remains returned into itself and indifferent to others. This&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifference&nbsp;</em>of a number to others is an essential determination of it and constitutes the implicit determinedness of the number, but also the number&#39;s own externality. Number is thus a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">numerical&nbsp;</em>one as the absolutely determinate one, which at the same time has the form of simple immediacy and for which, therefore, the relation to other is completely external.

In spatial magnitude, geometry has, in general, continuous magnitude for its subject matter while the subject matter of arithmetic is the discrete magnitude of number. But with this dissimilarity of their subject matter, the manner and completeness of their limitation or determinedness is also different. Spatial magnitude possesses only limitation generally; if it is to be considered as a thoroughly determinate quantum then&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">number&nbsp;</em>is required. Geometry as such does not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">measure</em>spatial figures (it is not mensuration), but only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">compares&nbsp;</em>them. In its definitions, too, the determinations are in part derived from the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equality&nbsp;</em>of the sides and angles, or from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equidistance.&nbsp;</em>Thus the circle, because it is based solely on the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equidistance&nbsp;</em>of all possible points in it from a centre, does not require number for its determination. These determinations based on equality or inequality are genuinely geometrical. But they are not sufficient, and for other figures, for example, the triangle or rectangle, number is requisite; this in its principle, the one, contains a self-determinedness, it is determined without the aid of an other and therefore not through comparison. It is true that in the point, spatial magnitude has a determinateness corresponding to the one; but the point, in becoming external to itself, becomes an other, becomes the line; because it is essentially only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">spatial&nbsp;</em>one, it becomes in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>a continuity in which the nature of the point, the self-determinedness, the one, is sublated. In so far as the self-determinedness is supposed to be preserved in the self-externality, the line must be represented as an aggregate of ones, and to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limit&nbsp;</em>must be imparted the determination of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">many&nbsp;</em>ones, that is, the magnitude of the line &mdash; and similarly of other spatial determinations &mdash; must be taken as a number.</p>

In arithmetic they are presented&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">seriatim&nbsp;</em>and it is clear that one depends on the other; but the thread which links the progressive stages is not made prominent in arithmetic. However, the systematic arrangement justly claimed for the presentation of these elements in the textbooks is readily provided by the determinations of number itself stemming from its Notion. These cardinal determinations will be briefly noted here.</p>

The first production of number is the aggregating of the many as such, each of which then is posited as only a one &mdash; numbering or counting. Since the ones are mutually external their representation is illustrated sensuously, and the operation by which number is generated is a process of counting on the fingers, dots, and so on. What four, five, etc.,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is,&nbsp;</em>can only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">be pointed out.&nbsp;</em>Seeing that the limit is an external one, the breaking off of the counting, the amount to be aggregated, is contingent, arbitrary. The difference of amount and unit which appears in the progress from one species of calculation to another, establishes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a system&nbsp;</em>of numbers, dyadic, decadic, and so on; such a system rests on the whole on the arbitrary choice of an amount which is consistently to be taken as unit.</p>

The sum of 5 and 7 means the mechanical [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">begrifflose</em>] conjunction of the two numbers, and the counting from seven onwards thus mechanically continued until the five units are exhausted can be called a putting together, a synthesis, just like counting from one onwards; but it is a synthesis wholly analytical in nature, for the connection is quite artificial, there is nothing in it or put into it which is not quite externally given. The postulate that 5 be added to 7, bears the same relation to the postulate of simply counting, as does the postulate that a straight line be produced to the postulate that a straight line be drawn.</p>

He admits that several are really analytic but only adduces one in support of his assertion that they are synthetic, namely, the axiom that the straight line is the shortest line between two points. &#39;For my notion of straightness contains nothing pertaining to magnitude, but only a quality; the notion of the shortest is, therefore, wholly an addition and cannot be inferred from any analysis of the notion of a straight line; we must therefore have recourse to intuition here which alone makes the synthesis possible.&#39; But here again the question is not of a notion of straightness as such but of a straight line, and this is already something spatial and intuited. The determination (or, if you like, the concept) of the straight line is, after all, none other than that the line is absolutely simple, that is, in coming out of itself (the so-called movement of the point) the line is purely self-related, and its extension does not involve any alteration in its determination, or reference to another point or line outside itself; it is a simple direction purely internal to the line. This simplicity is indeed its quality, and should it seem difficult to define the straight line analytically this would be due solely to the simplicity and self-relation of the determination, and merely because reflection thinks of determining primarily in terms of a plurality, a determining through something else. But there is no inherent difficulty whatever in grasping this determination of the simplicity of extension within the line, of the absence of determination by anything else; Euclid&#39;s definition contains nothing else than this simplicity. But now the transition of this quality to the quantitative determination (of the shortest) which is supposed to constitute the synthetic element is wholly analytical. As spatial, the line is quantity in general; the simplest in terms of quantum is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">least;&nbsp;</em>and this predicated of a line is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">shortest.&nbsp;</em>Geometry can accept these determinations as a corollary to the definition; but Archimedes in his books on the sphere and cylinder&#39; did the appropriate thing in making the said determination of a straight line into an axiom, in just as correct a sense as Euclid included the determination concerning parallel lines among the axioms, for the development of this determination into a definition would have required determinations not immediately spatial in character but of a more abstract qualitative kind, like simplicity, sameness of direction, and the like just mentioned. These ancients gave even to their sciences a plastic character, confining their exposition strictly to the peculiarity of their subject matter and therefore excluding what would have been heterogeneous to it.</p>

Of course, this notion is also present in intuition since it is the Notion itself and everything is implicitly the Notion; but the determinations selected in those examples do not exhibit it. On the contrary, number and counting is an identity and the creating of an identity which is wholly and solely external, only a superficial synthesis, a unity of ones which are, in fact, posited as inherently not identical with one another but as external, each separate on its own account; the determination of the straight line as being the shortest between two points is based rather on the moment of a merely abstract identity possessing no difference within itself.</p>

Here it is immaterial which of the two numbers is called unit and which amount, whether we say four times three, where four is the amount and three is the unit, or conversely, three times four. We have already indicated above that the original finding of the product is effected by simple counting, that is, counting off on the fingers, etc.; the subsequent ability to state the product immediately rests on the collection of these products, on the multiplication table and on knowing it by heart.</p>

Where a number is raised to a higher power than the square the continuation is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">formal:</em>&nbsp;partly, with even exponents, there is only a repetition of squaring, and partly, with uneven powers, inequality again enters; to take the nearest example of the cube, although formally there is an equality of the new factor with both the amount and the unit, this factor is, as unit, unequal to the amount (the square, 3, against 3 times 3); this is still more evident in the cube Of 4 where the amount, 3, which indicates the number of times the unit is to be multiplied by itself, is different from the number itself standing for the unit. We have here in principle those determinations of amount and unit which, as the essential difference of the Notion, have to be equalised before number as a going-out-of-itself has completely returned into itself. The foregoing exposition also contains the reason why first, the solution of higher equations must consist on their reduction to quadratics, and secondly, why equations with odd exponents can only be formally determined and, just when the roots are rational they cannot be found otherwise than by an imaginary expression, that is, by the opposite of that which the roots are and express. From what has been said, it is clear that the arithmetical square alone contains an immanent absolute determinedness; for which reason equations with further formal powers must be reduced to it, just as in geometry the right-angled triangle contains an immanent, absolute determinedness which is expounded in Pythagoras&#39; theorem, for which reason, too, all other geometrical figures must be reduced to it for their complete determination.</p>

However, philosophy must be able to distinguish what is an intrinsically self-external material; the progressive determining of it by the Notion can then take place only in an external manner, and its moments, too, can be only in the form peculiar to their externality, as here, equality and inequality. It is an essential requirement when philosophising about real objects to distinguish those spheres to which a specific form of the Notion belongs, that is, spheres in which the Notion has an actual existence; otherwise the peculiar nature of a subject matter which is external and contingent will be distorted by Ideas, and similarly these Ideas will be distorted and made into something merely formal. But here, the externality in which the moments of the Notion appear in this external material, number, is the appropriate form; since these moments exhibit the subject matter in its fixed differences, and since, too, they contain no demand for speculative thinking and therefore appear easy, they deserve to be employed in text books of the elements.</p>

From an educational point of view, number has been regarded as the most suitable object of inner intuition and arithmetical operations with number have been held to be the mental activity in which mind brings to view its most characteristic relationships and in general, the fundamental relationships of essence. How far number can claim this high worth is evident from its Notion as now before us.</p>

Arithmetic is an analytical science because all the combinations and differences which occur in its subject matter are not intrinsic to it but are effected on it in a wholly external manner. It does not have a concrete subject matter possessing inner, intrinsic, relationships which, as at first concealed, as not given in our immediate acquaintance with them, have first to be elicited by the efforts of cognition. Not only does it not contain the Notion and therefore no problem for speculative thought, but it is the antithesis of the Notion. Because of the indifference of the factors in combination to the combination itself in which there is no necessity, thought is engaged here in an activity which is at the same time the extreme externalisation of itself, an activity in which it is forced to move in a realm of thoughtlessness and to combine elements which are incapable of any necessary relationships. The subject matter is the abstract thought of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality itself.</em></p>

This is why we see number used for the expression of philosophemata early on in the history of philosophy. It forms the latest stage in that imperfection which contemplates the universal admixed with sense. The ancients were clearly aware that number stands midway between sense and thought. Aristotle quotes Plato as saying that the mathematical determinations of things stand apart from and midway between the world of the senses and the Ideas; they are distinguished from the former by being invisible (eternal) and unmoved, and from the latter by being a many and a like, where as the Idea is purely self-identical and within itself a one. A more detailed and profound reflection on this subject by Moderatus of Cadiz is quoted in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Malchi Vita Pythagorae.&nbsp;</em>That the Pythagoreans hit on numbers he ascribes to their inability to apprehend&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">clearly in reason&nbsp;</em>fundamental ideas and first principles, because these are hard to think and hard to express; numbers serve well as designations in instruction; in this among other things the Pythagoreans imitated the geometers who cannot express what is corporeal in thoughts and therefore use figures, saying &#39;this is a triangle&#39;, by which they do not mean that the visible drawing is to be taken for the triangle but only that it is a representation of the thought of it. Thus the Pythagoreans expressed the thought of unity, of self-sameness and equality and the ground of agreement, of connection and the sustaining of everything, of the self-identical, as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one.&nbsp;</em>It is superfluous to remark that the Pythagoreans passed on from numbers to thought as a medium of expression, to the express categories of like and unlike, of limit and infinity; even in respect of these numerical expressions it is reported that the Pythagoreans distinguished between the Monas and the one ; the Monas they took as the thought, but the one as the number, and similarly, they took two for the arithmetical term and the Dyas (for this is what it seems to mean there) for the thought of the indeterminate. These ancients at the outset perceived quite correctly the inadequacy of number forms for thought determinations and equally correctly they further demanded in place of this substitute for thoughts the characteristic expression; how much more advanced they were in their thinking than those who nowadays consider it praiseworthy, indeed profound, to revert to the puerile incapacity which again puts in the place of thought determinations numbers themselves and number-forms like powers, the infinitely great, the infinitely small, one divided by infinity, and other such determinations, which are themselves often only a perverted mathematical formalism.</p>

The difficulty in comprehending that, for example, one is three and three is one, stems from the fact that one is devoid of all relation and therefore does not in its own self exhibit the determination through which it passes into its opposite; on the contrary, one is essentially a sheer excluding and rejection of such a relation. Conversely, understanding makes use of this to combat speculative truth (as, for example, against the truth laid down in the doctrine called the trinity) and it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">counts&nbsp;</em>the determinations of it which constitute one unity, in order to expose them as sheer absurdity &mdash; that is, understanding itself commits the same absurdity of making that which is pure relation into something devoid of all relation.

Whatever profound wisdom may be supposed to lie in such meagre symbols or in those richer products of fantasy in the mythology of peoples and in poetry generally, it is properly for thought alone to make explicit for consciousness the wisdom that lies only in them; and not only in symbols but in nature and in mind.

In the concrete philosophical sciences philosophy must take the logical element from logic, not from mathematics; it can only be an expedient of philosophical incapacity which, instead of going to philosophy for the logical element, has recourse to the shapes assumed by the logical element in other sciences, many of which shapes are only adumbrations of that element, others even defective forms of it. Apart from this, the mere application of such borrowed forms is an external procedure; the application itself must be preceded by an awareness not only of their meaning but of their value, too, and such awareness can come only from reflecting on them, not from the authority of mathematics. But logic itself is such awareness and it strips these forms of their particularity which it renders superfluous and unnecessary; it is logic which rectifies these forms and alone procures for them their justification, meaning and value.</p>

Number is a non-sensuous object, and occupation with it and its combinations is a non-sensuous business; in it mind is held to communing with itself and to an inner abstract labour, a matter of great though one-sided importance. For, on the other hand, since the basis of number in only an external, thoughtless difference, such occupation is an unthinking, mechanical one. The effort consists mainly in holding fast what is devoid of the Notion and in combining it purely mechanically. The content is the empty one; the substantial content of moral and spiritual life in its various forms on which, as the noblest aliment, education should nurture the young mind, is to be supplanted by the blank one or unit; when such exercise is made the prime interest and occupation, the only possible outcome must be to dull the mind and to empty it of both form and substance. Calculation being so much an external and therefore mechanical business, it has been possible to construct machines which perform arithmetical operations with complete accuracy. A knowledge of just this one fact about the nature of calculation is sufficient for an appraisal of the idea of making calculation the principal means for educating the mind and stretching it on the rack in order to perfect it as a machine.</p>

That is to say, the form of self-relation which it has in degree is at the same time&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the externality of the degree to its own self.&nbsp;</em>Number, as an extensive quantum, is a numerical plurality and so has the externality within itself. This externality, as simply a plurality, collapses into undifferentiatedness and sublates itself in the numerical one, in its self-relation. Quantum, however, has its determinateness as an amount; it contains this, as we have already seen, even though the amount is no longer posited in it. Degree, therefore, which, as in its own self unitary, no longer has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within&nbsp;</em>itself this external otherness, has it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside&nbsp;</em>itself and relates itself to it as to its determinateness. A plurality external to the degree constitutes the determinateness of the simple limit which the degree is for itself. In extensive quantum amount, in so far as it was supposed to be present in the number, was so only as sublated; now it is determined as placed outside the number. Number as a one, being posited as self-relation reflected into itself, excludes from itself the indifference and externality of the amount and is self-relation&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as relation through itself to an externality.</em></p>

The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifference&nbsp;</em>of the determinateness constitutes its quality, that is, the determinateness which is in its own self a self-external determinateness. Accordingly, degree is a unitary quantitative determinateness among a plurality of such intensifies which, though differing from each other, each being only a simple self-relation, are at the same time essentially interrelated so that each has its determinateness in this continuity with the others. This relation of degree through itself to its other makes ascent and descent in the scale of degrees a continuous progress, a flux, which is an uninterrupted, indivisible alteration; none of the various distinct degrees is separate from the others but each is determined only through them. As a self-related determination of quantity, each degree is indifferent to the others; but it is just as much implicitly related to this externality, it is only through this externality that it is what it is; its relation to itself is, in short, the non-indifferent relation to externality, and in this it has its quality.</p>

Intensive magnitude is primarily a unitary one of a plurality; there are many degrees, but they are determined neither as a simple one nor as a plurality, but only in the relation of this self-externality, or in the identity of the one and the plurality. if, therefore, the many as such are indeed outside the simple, unitary degree, nevertheless the determinateness of the degree consists in its relation to them; it thus contains amount. just as twenty, as an extensive magnitude, contains the twenty ones as discrete within it, so does the specific degree contain them as the continuity which this determinate plurality simply is; it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">twentieth&nbsp;</em>degree, and is the twentieth degree only by virtue of this amount, which as such is outside it.</p>

Intensive magnitude is determined&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">by other</em>intensive quanta and is continuous with its otherness, so that its determinateness consists in this relation to its otherness. Now in the first place, in so far as it is a simple determinateness it is determinate&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relatively&nbsp;</em>to other degrees; it excludes them from itself and has its determinateness in this exclusion. But, secondly, it is determinate in its own self; this it is in the amount as its own amount, not in the amount as excluded, nor in the amount of other degrees. The twentieth degree contains the twenty within itself; it is not only determined as distinguished from the nineteenth, twenty-first, and so on, but its determinateness is its own amount. But in so far as the amount is its own &mdash; and the determinateness is at the same time essentially an amount &mdash; the degree is an extensive quantum.</p>

One is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>an extensive magnitude, it can be represented as an arbitrary amount of parts. Thus the tenth, the hundredth, is this simple, intensive magnitude which has its determinateness in the plurality lying outside it, that is, in extensive magnitude. Number is a ten, a hundred and at the same time the tenth, hundredth, in the system of numbers; both are the same determinateness.</p>

Thus, for example, a mass as weight is an extensive magnitude, in so far as it constitutes an amount of pounds, hundredweights, etc., and an intensive magnitude in so far as it exerts a certain pressure; the magnitude of the pressure is a simple number, a degree, which is specified by its place in a scale of degrees.

In his criticism of metaphysical propositions about the soul, which he calls paralogisms of pure reason, he comes to consider the inference from the simplicity of the soul to its permanence&#39; He counters this argument by saying &#39;that even if we admit the simple nature of the soul since, namely, it does not contain a plurality of separate parts and therefore no extensive magnitude, yet we cannot deny to it, any more than to any other existent thing, an intensive magnitude, that is, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degree&nbsp;</em>of reality in respect of all its faculties, indeed, in respect of all that constitutes its existence; this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degree&nbsp;</em>can diminish through all the infinitely many smaller degrees so that although the postulated substance cannot be reduced to nothing by division (into parts), it can be so reduced by a gradual lessening&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">(remissio</em>) of its powers. For&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consciousness</em>&nbsp;itself has, at any moment, a degree which can always be diminished, and the same must therefore also be true of its faculty of being aware of itself and thus of all the other faculties. In rational psychology, which is an abstract metaphysics, the soul is considered not as spirit but as a merely immediate being, as a soul thing. Kant thus has the right to apply the category of quantum to it &#39;as to any other existent thing&#39;, and in so far as this immediate being is determined as simple, to apply to it the category of intensive quantum.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Being&nbsp;</em>does, of course, belong to spirit, but its intensity is wholly different from that of intensive quantum; indeed, its intensity is such that in it the form of merely immediate being and all its categories are sublated. What should have been admitted was the elimination not only of the category of extensive quantum but that of quantum altogether. But a further advance has still to be made, namely, to understand how existence, consciousness, finitude, is in the eternal nature of spirit and proceeds from it without spirit thereby becoming a thing.</p>

In extensive magnitude this difference is developed; but intensive magnitude is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existence&nbsp;</em>of this externality which quantum is within itself.

Quantum becomes an other; but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">it continues&nbsp;</em>itself into its otherness; the other is thus also a quantum. This, however, is not only the other of a particular quantum, but of quantum itself, the negative of quantum as limited; hence it is the unlimitedness of quantum, its infinity. Quantum is an ought-to-be; it is by implication determined as being for itself, and this being-determined-for-itself is rather the being-determined-in-an-other, and, conversely, it is the sublation of being-determined-in-an-other, is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifferent&nbsp;</em>subsisting for itself.</p>

The quantum is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finite,</em>&nbsp;in the first place simply as limited, and secondly, as impelled beyond itself, as being determined in an other. But the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinity</em>&nbsp;of quantum is first, its unlimitedness, and secondly, its returnedness into itself, its indifferent being-for-self. If we now compare these moments with each other, we find that the determination of the finitude of quantum, the impulse to go beyond itself to an other in which its determination lies, is equally the determination of the infinite; the negation of the limit is the same impulsion beyond the determinateness, so that in this negation, in the infinite, quantum possesses its final determinateness. The other moment of infinity is the being-for-self which is indifferent to the limit; but the limiting of quantum itself is such that quantum is explicitly indifferent to its limit, and hence to other quanta and to its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond.&nbsp;</em>In quantum, finitude and infinity (the spurious infinity supposedly separate from the finite) each already has within it the moment of the other.</p>

It is the reciprocal determining of the finite and infinite which was considered in the sphere of quality, with the difference that, as just remarked, in the sphere of quantity the limit in its own self dispatches and continues itself into its beyond and hence, conversely, the quantitative infinite too is posited as having quantum within it; for quantum in its self-externality is also its own self, its externality belongs to its determination.</p>

As at first posed, it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">problem</em>&nbsp;of attaining the infinite, not the actual reaching of it; it is the perpetual&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">generation&nbsp;</em>of the infinite, but it does not get beyond quantum, nor does the infinite become positively present. It belongs to the Notion of quantum to have a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond&nbsp;</em>of itself. This beyond is first, the abstract moment of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-being&nbsp;</em>of quantum: the vanishing of quantum is its own act; it is thus related to its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond&nbsp;</em>as to its infinity, in accordance with the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative&nbsp;</em>moment of the opposition. Secondly, however, quantum is continuous with its beyond; quantum consists precisely in being the other of itself, in being external to itself; this externality is, therefore, no more an other than quantum itself; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond&nbsp;</em>or the infinite is, therefore, itself&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a quantum.&nbsp;</em>In this way, the beyond is recalled from its flight and the infinite is attained. But because the infinite now affirmatively present is again a quantum, what has been posited is only a fresh limit; this, too, as a quantum, has again fled from itself, is as such beyond itself and has repelled itself into its non-being, into its own beyond, and as it thus repels itself into the beyond, so equally does the beyond perpetually become a quantum.</p>

Since both still bear the character of quantum they remain alterable, and the absolute determinateness which would be a being-for-self is, therefore, not attained. This&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-externality of</em>&nbsp;the determination is posited in the dual infinite &mdash; which is opposed to itself as a &#39;more&#39; and a &#39;less&#39; &mdash; in the infinitely great and infinitely small. In each, the quantum is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">maintained&nbsp;</em>in perpetual opposition to its beyond. No matter how much the quantum is increased, it shrinks to insignificance; because quantum is related to the infinite as to its non-being, the opposition is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative; the</em>&nbsp;increased quantum has therefore gained nothing from the infinite, which is now, as before, the non-being of quantum. In other words, the increase of quantum brings it no&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nearer&nbsp;</em>to the infinite; for the difference between quantum and its infinity is essentially&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not&nbsp;</em>a quantitative difference. The expression &#39;the infinitely great&#39; only throws the contradiction into sharper relief; it is supposed to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">great,&nbsp;</em>that is, a quantum, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite,&nbsp;</em>that is, not a quantum. Similarly, the infinitely small is, as small, a quantum, and therefore remains absolutely, that is, qualitatively, too great for the infinite and is opposed to it. In both, there remains the contradiction of the infinite progress which in them should have reached its goal.</p>

It is true that in the quantitative progress the movement is not simply towards an abstract&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>in general, but towards an explicitly different quantum; but this remains in the same way opposed to its negation. The progress, too, is therefore not a real advance but a repetition of one and the same thing, a positing, a sublating, and then again a positing and again a sublating, an impotence of the negative, for what it sublates is continuous with it, and in the very act of being sublated returns to it. Thus there are two terms, the bond between which is such that they simply flee from each other; and in fleeing from each other they cannot become separated but are joined together even in their flight from each other.</p>

This progression has often been the theme of tirades which have been admired as sublime productions. As a matter of fact, however, this modern sublimity does not magnify the object &mdash; rather does this take flight &mdash; but only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subject&nbsp;</em>which assimilates such vast quantities. The hollowness of this exaltation, which in scaling the ladder of the quantitative still remains subjective, finds expression in its own admission of the futility of its efforts to get nearer to the infinite goal, the attainment of which must, indeed, be achieved by a quite different method.</p>

Imagination fails before this progress into the infinitely remote, where beyond the most distant world there is a still more distant one, and the past, however remote, has a still remoter past behind it, the future, however distant, a still more distant future beyond it; thought fails in the face of this conception of the immeasurable, just as a dream, in which one goes on and on down a corridor which stretches away endlessly out of sight, finishes with falling or fainting.&#39;</p>

But this pure ego, because it has fixed itself in its abstraction and emptiness, has determinate reality, the fulness of the universe of nature and mind, confronting it as a beyond. We are faced with that same contradiction which lies at the base of the infinite progress, namely a returnedness-into-self which is at the same time immediately an out-of-selfness, a relation to its other as to its non-being; and this relation remains&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a longing,&nbsp;</em>because on the one side is the unsubstantial, untenable void of the ego fixed as such by the ego itself, and on the other, the fulness which though negated remains present, but is fixed by the ego as its beyond.</p>

The just quoted antithesis of finite and infinite in the shape of the manifold world and the ego raised to its freedom, is primarily qualitative. The ego in its self-determining forthwith proceeds to determine nature and to liberate itself therefrom; it thus connects itself through itself with its other which, as an external reality, is manifold and quantitative. The relation to the quantitative becomes itself quantitative; the negative relation of the ego to it, the power of the ego over the non-ego, over sense and outer nature, is consequently so conceived that morality can and ought continually to increase, and the power of sense continually to diminish. But the perfect adequacy of the will to the moral law is placed in the unending progress to infinity, that is, is represented as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolutely unattainable&nbsp;</em>beyond, and this very unattainableness is supposed to be the true sheet-anchor and fitting consolation; for morality is supposed to be a struggle, but such it can be oily if the will is inadequate to the moral law which thus becomes a sheer beyond for it.</p>

The pure will has its own appropriate law which stands in an essential relationship to the sphere of sense; and nature and sense on&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its&nbsp;</em>side has laws which neither stem from nor are conformable to the will nor, although distinct from it, have they even in principle an essential connection with it but are determined independently, are finished and complete in themselves. At the same time, however, both are moments of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one and the same simple being,&nbsp;</em>the ego; the will is determined as the negative in relation to nature so that the will only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>in so far as there is a sphere distinct from it which it sublates, but with which it thereby comes into contact and by which it is itself affected. Nature itself and nature as the sensuous sphere of man, as an independent system of laws, is indifferent to limitation by an other; it preserves itself in this process of limitation, enters into the relation as an independent factor and limits the will of law just as much as this limits it. The two processes comprise a single act: the self-determining of the will with the sublating of the otherness of nature, and the positing of this otherness as continuing itself as a reality in the process of being sublated, so that the otherness is not sublated. The contradiction involved in this is not resolved in the infinite progress: on the contrary, it is represented and affirmed as unresolved and unresolvable; the conflict of morality and sense is represented as the ultimate, absolute relation.</p>

Nature is determined by the ego, sense by the will of the good; the alteration produced in sense by the will is only a quantitative difference, one which leaves sense itself unchanged.</p>

In this exposition, the first axiom, ego = ego, is followed by a second, independent of it, the opposition of the non-ego; the relation between the two is also directly assumed as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative</em>difference, that is, the non-ego is partly determined by the ego, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">partly&nbsp;</em>not. In this way, the non-ego is continued into its non-being in such wise that in its non-being it remains opposed as something not sublated. Consequently, after the contradictions contained in this have been developed in the system, the final result is that relationship which formed the beginning: the non-ego remains an infinite obstacle, an absolute other; the final relation of the non-ego and the ego to each other is the infinite progress, a longing and aspiration &mdash; the same contradiction with which the system began.</p>

That all opposition is only quantitative was for some time a cardinal thesis of recent philosophy; the opposed determinations have the same nature, the same content; they are real sides of the opposition in so far as each of them has within it both determinations, both factors of the opposition, only that on one side one of the factors&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">preponderates,&nbsp;</em>on the other side the other, that is, one of the factors, a material substance or activity, is present in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">greater quantity&nbsp;</em>or in an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intenser degree&nbsp;</em>in one side than in the other. But in so far as substances or activities are presupposed, the quantitative difference rather confirms and completes their externality and indifference to each other and to their unity. The difference of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute&nbsp;</em>unity is supposed to be only quantitative; the quantitative, it is true, is immediate, sublated determinateness, but only the imperfect, as yet only first, negation, not the infinite, not the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation&nbsp;</em>of the negation. When<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being and thought&nbsp;</em>are represented as quantitative determinations of absolute substance they too, as quanta, become completely external to each other and unrelated as, in a subordinate sphere, do carbon, nitrogen, etc. It is a third, an external reflection, which abstracts from their difference and recognises their unity, but a unity which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inner, implicit&nbsp;</em>only, not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for itself.&nbsp;</em>This unity is, therefore, in fact conceived only as a first,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>unity, or only as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being,&nbsp;</em>which in its quantitative difference&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">remains like</em>&nbsp;itself, but does not of itself&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posit&nbsp;</em>itself as like itself; hence it is not grasped as a negation of the negation, as an infinite unity. Only in the qualitative opposition does the posited infinitude, being-for-self, emerge and the quantitative determination itself pass over into the qualitative, as we shall presently find.</p>

The antinomy there considered contained the opposition of qualitative finitude and infinitude. In another, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first&nbsp;</em>of the four cosmological antinomics, it is the conflict arising rather from the quantitative limit which is considered. I shall therefore proceed to examine this antinomy here.</p>

<p class="quote" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20px; margin-left: 91.09375px; margin-right: 91.09375px; text-align: justify;">&#39;The world has no beginning in time; therefore, up to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">any given point of time,&nbsp;</em>an eternity has elapsed and consequently an infinite series of successive states of things in the world has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">passed away.&nbsp;</em>Now the infinity of a series consists precisely in the impossibility of ever&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">completing&nbsp;</em>it by successive synthesis. Therefore an infinite world series which has passed away is impossible and consequently a beginning of the world is a necessary condition of its existence &mdash; which was to be proved.&#39;</p>

To comprehend a spatially infinite world would require an infinite time and this time must be regarded as having already elapsed in so far as the world in space is to be regarded not as gradually coming to be but as completely given. But it was shown of time in the first part of the proof that it is impossible to assume an infinite time as elapsed.</p>

Namely, there is assumed some or any&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">given point of time&nbsp;</em>up to which an eternity has elapsed (eternity here has only the trivial meaning of a simply endless time). Now a given point of time means nothing else than a definite limit in time. In the proof therefore, a limit of time is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposed&nbsp;</em>as actual; but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">that&nbsp;</em>is just what&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">was to be proved.</em>For the thesis is, that the world has a beginning in time.</p>

But this difference is immaterial. The now is taken as the point in which an infinite series of successive states of things in the world is supposed to have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">passed away,&nbsp;</em>therefore as end, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative&nbsp;</em>limit. If this now were considered to be merely a quantitative limit which flows on and which not only must be transcended but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>only as the transcending of itself, then the infinite time series would not have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">passed away&nbsp;</em>in it, but would continue to flow on, and so the argument of the proof would vanish. On the other hand, if the point of time is assumed as a qualitative limit for the past, in which case it is also a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beginning</em>for the future (for each point of time is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>the connection of the past and the future), then it is also an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute,&nbsp;</em>that is, abstract<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beginning&nbsp;</em>for the future &mdash; and it was this that was to be proved. The fact that its future and this its beginning is already preceded by a past does not affect the argument; because this point of time is a qualitative limit &mdash; and that it is to be taken as qualitative is implied in the description of it as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">completed,&nbsp;</em>elapsed, and therefore as not continuing &mdash; therefore in it time is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">broken&nbsp;</em>off and the past lacks a connection with this time which could only be called future with reference to that past and, consequently, without such connection is only time as such, which has an absolute beginning. But if &mdash; as is, then, the case &mdash; it were related to the past through the now, the given point of time, and were thus determined as a future, then this point of time, too, regarded from the other side, would not be a limit; the infinite time series would continue itself in what was called future and would not be, as was assumed,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">completed.</em></p>

Since the beginning is an existence preceded by a time in which the thing is not, there must have been a preceding time in which the world was not, that is, an empty time. Now no originating of anything is possible in an empty time; because no part of such a time possesses&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>&nbsp;and in preference to any other, any distinguishing condition of existence or non-existence. In the world, therefore, many groups of things can indeed begin, but the world itself can have no beginning and with respect to past time is infinite.&#39;</p>

That is, it first assumes a beyond of the existing world, an empty time; but it also equally&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continues&nbsp;</em>the existence of the world beyond itself into this empty time which is thereby sublated, with the result that the existence of the world is continued into infinity. The world is an existence; the proof&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposes&nbsp;</em>that this existence&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comes into being&nbsp;</em>and that the coming-to-be has an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">antecedent condition&nbsp;</em>which is in time. But the antithesis itself consists in the very fact that there is no unconditioned existence, no absolute limit, but that the existence of the world always requires an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">antecedent condition.&nbsp;</em>Thus, what was to be proved is found as an assumption in the proof. Further, the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">condition&nbsp;</em>is sought in empty time, which means in effect that it is taken as temporal and therefore as an existence and as limited. Altogether, then, the assumption is made that the world as an existence presupposes another conditioned existence in time, and so on, therefore, to infinity.</p>

In point of fact it is spirit which is so strong that it can endure contradiction, but it is spirit, too, that knows how to resolve it. But the so-called world (whether it be called an objective, real world or, according to transcendental idealism, a subjective intuition and a sphere of sense determined by the categories of the understanding) is never and nowhere without contradiction, but it is unable to endure it and is, therefore, subject to coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be.</p>

Its truth is their unity in which they are, but only as moments. It is the resolution of the contradiction of which it is the expression, and its immediate significance is, therefore, the restoration of the Notion of quantity, namely, that quantity is an indifferent or external limit. In the infinite progress as such, the only reflection usually made is that every quantum, however great or small, must be capable of vanishing, of being surpassed; but not that this self-sublating of quantum, the beyond, the spurious infinite itself also vanishes.</p>

But we have seen that in this something more is present, the negation of the negation, or that which the infinite in truth is. We regarded this previously as the restoration of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>of quantity; this restoration means in the first place, that its determinate being has received a more precise determination; we now have quantum determined in conformity with its Notion, which is different from quantum in its immediacy; externality is now the opposite of itself, posited as a moment of quantity itself &mdash; quantum is posited as having its determinateness in another quantum by means of its non-being, of infinity; that is, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitatively&nbsp;</em>that which it is. However, this comparison of the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>of quantum with its determinate being belongs more to our reflection, to a relationship which is not yet present here. The immediately following determination is that the quantum has reverted to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quality,&nbsp;</em>is from now on qualitatively determined. For its peculiarity, its quality, is the externality, the indifference of the determinateness; and quantum is now posited as being in fact&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">itself&nbsp;</em>in its externality, as self-related therein, in simple unity with itself, that is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitatively</em>&nbsp;determined. This qualitative moment is still more closely determined, namely as being-for-itself; for the self-relation to which it has attained has proceeded from mediation, from the negation of the negation. Quantum has infinity, self-determinedness, no longer outside it but within itself.</p>

On the one hand its introduction into mathematics has led to an expansion of the science and to important results; but on the other hand it is remarkable that mathematics has not yet succeeded in justifying its use of this infinite by the Notion (Notion taken in its proper meaning). Ultimately, the justifications are based on the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">correctness of the results&nbsp;</em>obtained with the aid of the said infinite, which correctness is proved on quite other grounds: but the justifications are not based on the clarity of the subject matter and on the operation through which the results are obtained, for it is even admitted that the operation itself is incorrect.</p>

Often, the science of mathematics can only defend itself against these objections by denying the competence of metaphysics, asserting that it has nothing to do with that science and does not have to trouble itself about metaphysical concepts so long as it operates consistently within its own sphere. Mathematics has to consider not what is true in itself but what is true in its own domain. Metaphysics, though disagreeing with the use of the mathematical infinite, cannot deny or invalidate the brilliant results obtained from it, and mathematics cannot reach clearness about the metaphysics of its own concept or, therefore, about the derivation of the modes of procedure necessitated by the use of the infinite.</p>

But mathematics, in the method of its infinite, finds a radical contradiction to that very method which is peculiar to itself and on which as a science it rests. For the infinitesimal calculus permits and requires modes of procedure which mathematics must wholly reject when operating with finite quantities, and at the same time it treats these infinite quantities as if they were finite and insists on applying to the former the same modes of operation which are valid for the latter; it is a cardinal feature in the development of this science that it has succeeded in applying to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transcendental deter</em>minations and their treatment the form of ordinary calculation.</p>

But in the first place, this does not apply to every result and the introduction of the infinite is not for the sole purpose of shortening the ordinary method but in order to obtain results which this method is unable to secure. Secondly, success does not by itself justify the mode of procedure. This procedure of the infinitesimal calculus shows itself burdened with a seeming inexactitude, namely, having increased finite magnitudes by an infinitely small quantity, this quantity is in the subsequent operation in part retained and in part ignored. The peculiarity of this procedure is that in spite of the admitted inexactitude, a result is obtained which is not merely fairly close and such that the difference can be ignored, but is perfectly exact. In the operation itself, however, which precedes the result, one cannot dispense with the conception that a quantity is not equal to nothing, yet is so inconsiderable that it can be left out of account. However, what is to be understood by mathematical determinateness altogether rules out any distinction of a greater or lesser degree of exactitude, just as in philosophy there can be no question of greater or less probability but solely of Truth. Even if the method and use of the infinite is justified by the result, it is nevertheless not so superfluous to demand its justification as it seems in the case of the nose to ask for a proof of the right to use it. For mathematical knowledge is scientific knowledge, so that the proof is essential; and even with respect to results it is a fact that a rigorous mathematical method does not stamp all of them with the mark of success, which in any case is only external.</p>

The consideration of these justifications and characteristics of the mathematical infinite which I shall undertake at some length in this Remark will at the same time throw the best light on the nature of the true Notion itself and show how this latter was vaguely present as a basis for those procedures.</p>

It is true that in this definition the true Notion is not expressed but only, as already remarked, the same contradiction which is present in the infinite progress; but let us see what is implicitly contained in it. In mathematics a magnitude is defined as that which can be increased or diminished; in general, as an indifferent limit. Now since the infinitely great or small is that which cannot be increased or diminished, it is in fact no longer a quantum as such.</p>

But it is just the reflection that quantum (and in this remark quantum as such, as we find it, I call finite quantum) is sublated, which is usually not made, and which creates the difficulty for ordinary thinking; for quantum in so far as it is infinite is required to be thought as sublated, as something which is not a quantum but yet retains its quantitative character.</p>

According as this assumed unit is greater or smaller, the infinite would be greater or smaller. The infinity, however, since it consists solely in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>to this given unit, would always remain the same, although of course the absolute magnitude of the whole would not be known through it.&#39;</p>

The maximum or minimum as such still appears as a quantum, an amount. Such a conception cannot avert the conclusion, adduced by Kant, which leads to a greater or lesser infinite. And in general, so long as the infinite is represented as a quantum, the distinction of greater or less still applies to it. This criticism does not however apply to the Notion of the genuine mathematical infinite, of the infinite difference, for this is no longer a finite quantum.</p>

A quantum as such is presupposed as given; by synthesising the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unit</em>&nbsp;this is supposed to be converted into an amount, into a definite assignable quantum; but this synthesis, it is said, can never be completed. It is evident from this that we have here nothing but an expression of the progress to infinity, only represented&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transcendentally,&nbsp;</em>i.e. properly speaking, subjectively and psychologically. True, in itself the quantum is supposed to be completed; but transcendentally, namely in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subject&nbsp;</em>which gives it a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>to a unit, the quantum comes to be determined only as incomplete and as simply burdened with a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond.&nbsp;</em>Here, therefore, there is no advance beyond the contradiction contained in quantity; but the contradiction is distributed between the object and the subject, limitedness being ascribed to the former, and to the latter the progress to infinity, in its spurious sense, beyond every assigned determinateness.</p>

In the first place, as regards the true infinite quantum, it was characterised as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own self&nbsp;</em>infinite; it is such because, as we have seen, the finite quantum or quantum as such and its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond,&nbsp;</em>the spurious infinite, are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equally&nbsp;</em>sublated.

Such fraction, 2/7 for example, is not a quantum like 1, 2, 3, etc.; although it is an ordinary finite number it is not an immediate one like the whole numbers but, as a fraction, is directly determined by two other numbers which are related to each other as amount and unit, the unit itself being a specific amount. However, if we abstract from this more precise determination of them and consider them solely as quanta in the qualitative relation in which they are here, then 2 and 7 are indifferent quanta; but since they appear here only as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moments,</em>&nbsp;the one of the other, and consequently of a third (of the quantum which is called the exponent), they directly count no longer simply as 2 and 7 but only according to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific relationship in</em>&nbsp;which they stand to each other. In their place, therefore, we can just as well put 4 and 14, or 6 and 21, and so on to infinity. With this, then, they begin to have a qualitative character. If 2 and 7 counted as mere quanta, then 2 is just 2 and nothing more, and 7 is simply 7; 4, 14, 6, 21 etc., are completely different from them and, as only immediate quanta, cannot be substituted for them. But in so far as 2 and 7 are not to be taken as such immediate quanta their indifferent limit is sublated; on this side therefore they contain the moment of infinity, since not only are they no longer merely 2 and 7, but their quantitative determinateness remains &mdash; but as one which is in itself qualitative, namely in accordance with their significance as moments in the ratio. Their place can be taken by infinitely many others without the value of the fraction being altered, by virtue of the determinateness possessed by the ratio.</p>

A comparison of the two expressions shows that one of them, the infinite series, represents the fraction no longer as a ratio but from that side where it is a quantum as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">aggregate&nbsp;</em>of units added together, as an amount. That the magnitudes of which it is supposed to consist as amount are in turn decimal fractions and therefore are themselves ratios, is irrelevant here; for this circumstance concerns the particular kind of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unit&nbsp;</em>of these magnitudes, not the magnitudes as constituting an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount.&nbsp;</em>just as a multi-figured integer in the decimal system is reckoned essentially as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount,</em>&nbsp;and the fact that it consists of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">products&nbsp;</em>of a number and of the number ten and powers of ten is ignored.

That is to say, the absolute affirmation of an existence is to be taken as its relation to itself, its not being dependent on an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other;&nbsp;</em>the finite, on the other hand, is negation, a ceasing-to-be in the form of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>to an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other</em>&nbsp;which begins<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside&nbsp;</em>it. Now the absolute affirmation of an existence does not, it is true, exhaust the notion of infinity; this implies that infinity is an affirmation, not as immediate, but only as restored by the reflection of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>into itself, or as negation of the negative. But with Spinoza, substance and its absolute unity has the form of an inert unity, i.e. of a unity which is not self-mediated, of a fixity or rigidity in which the Notion of the negative unity of the self, i.e. subjectivity, is still lacking.</p>

It seems that he thought highly of this figure and of the concept which it was used to illustrate, making it the motto of his&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Ethics.&nbsp;</em>&#39;Mathematicians conclude&#39;, he says, &#39;that the inequalities possible in such a space are infinite, not from the infinite&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount&nbsp;</em>of parts, for its size is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fixed and limited and&nbsp;</em>1 can assume larger and smaller such spaces, but because the nature of the fact surpasses every determinateness.&#39; It is evident that Spinoza rejects that conception of the infinite which represents it as an amount or as a series which is not completed, and he points out that here, in the space of his example, the infinite is not beyond, but actually present and complete; this space is bounded, but it is infinite &#39;because the nature of the fact surpasses every determinateness&#39;, because the determination of magnitude contained in it cannot at the same time be represented as a quantum, or in Kant&#39;s words already quoted, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">synthesis&nbsp;</em>cannot be completed to form a (discrete) quantum. How in general the opposition of continuous and discrete quantum leads to the infinite, will be shown in detail in a later Remark. Spinoza calls the infinite of a series the infinite of the imagination; on the other hand, the infinite as self-relation he calls the infinite of thought, or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinitum actu.&nbsp;</em>It is, namely,<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actu, actually&nbsp;</em>infinite because it is complete and present within itself. Thus the series 0.285714 ... or 1&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">+&nbsp;</em>a + a<sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;+ a<sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">3</sup>&nbsp;... is the infinite merely of imagination or supposition; for it has no actuality, it definitely lacks something; on the other hand 2/7 or 1/(1 - a)&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is actually</em>not only what the series is in its developed terms, but is, in addition, what the series lacks, what it only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ought to be.&nbsp;</em>The 2/7 or 1/(1 - a) is equally a finite magnitude like Spinoza&#39;s space enclosed between two circles, with its inequalities, and can like this space be made larger or smaller. But this does not involve the absurdity of a larger or smaller infinite; for this quantum of the whole does not concern the relation of its moments,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the nature of the fact,&nbsp;</em>i.e. the qualitative determination of magnitude; what is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actually present&nbsp;</em>in the infinite series is equally a finite quantum, but it is also still deficient.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Imagination&nbsp;</em>on the contrary stops short at quantum as such and does not reflect on the qualitative relation which constitutes the ground of the existing incommensurability.</p>

In 2/7 or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">b</em>, 2 and 7 are each independent determinate quanta and the relation is not essential to them; a and b likewise are intended to represent quanta which remain what they are even outside the relation. And further, 2/7 and a/b are each a fixed quantum, a quotient; the ratio constitutes an amount, the unit of which is expressed by the denominator and the amount of these units by the numerator, or conversely; even if 4 and 14, and so on, are substituted for 2 and 7, the ratio, also as a quantum, remains the same. But now in the function&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p</em>, for example, this is essentially changed; here, it is true that x and y can stand for definite quanta, but only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;have a determinate quotient, not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>. Hence not only are these&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sides&nbsp;</em>of the ratio&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>, not any determinate quanta, but, secondly, their ratio is not a fixed quantum (nor is such a quantum meant as in the case of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">b</em>), not a fixed quotient, but this quotient is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as a quantum,</em>&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">variable.&nbsp;</em>But this is solely because x has a relation, not to y, but to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">square of y.&nbsp;</em>The relation of a magnitude to a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">power&nbsp;</em>is not a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantum,&nbsp;</em>but essentially a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative</em>relation; the power-relation is the feature which is to be regarded as the fundamental determination. But in the function of the straight line&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y = ax, a&nbsp;</em>is an ordinary fraction and quotient; consequently this function is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">formally&nbsp;</em>a function of variable magnitudes, or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>&nbsp;here are what&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">b</em>&nbsp;are in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">b</em>&nbsp;that is, they are not in that determination in which the differential and integral calculus considers them. On account of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">special&nbsp;</em>nature of the variable magnitudes in this mode of consideration, it would have been fitting to have introduced both a special name for them and other&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">symbols&nbsp;</em>than those generally used for unknown&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantities</em>&nbsp;in any finite equation, determinate or indeterminate; for there is an essential difference between those magnitudes and such quanta which are merely unknown, but are in themselves completely determined or are a definite range of determinate quanta. It is, too, only because of a lack of awareness of what constitutes the peculiar interest of higher analysis and of what has led to the need for and invention of the differential calculus, that functions of the first degree and the equation of the straight line are themselves included in the treatment of this calculus; such formalism originates partly, too, in the mistake of imagining that the intrinsically correct demand for the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">generalisation&nbsp;</em>of a method has been fulfilled when the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific&nbsp;</em>determinateness on which the need for the calculus is based is omitted, as if in this domain we were concerned only with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">variable magnitudes.&nbsp;</em>A great deal of formalism would, indeed, have been avoided if it had been perceived that the calculus is concerned not with variable magnitudes as such but with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relations of powers.</em></p>

But mathematics, as we remarked above, cannot evade the Notion here; for, as mathematics of the infinite, it does not confine itself to the finite determinateness of its objects (as in ordinary mathematics, which considers and relates space and number and their determinations only according to their finitude); on the contrary, when it treats a determination taken from ordinary mathematics, it converts it into an identity with its opposite, e.g. converting a curved line into a straight one, the circle into a polygon, etc. Consequently, the operations which it allows itself to perform in the differential and integral calculus are in complete contradiction with the nature of merely finite determinations and their relations and would therefore have to be justified solely by the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion.</em></p>

I eliminate here those determinations which belong to the idea of motion and velocity (from which, mainly, he took the name of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fluxions</em>) because in them the thought does not appear in its proper abstraction but as concrete and mixed with non-essential forms. Newton explains that he understands by these fluxions not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indivisibles&nbsp;</em>(a form which was used by earlier mathematicians, Cavalieri and others and which involves the concept of an intrinsically determinate quantum), but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vanishing divisibles;&nbsp;</em>also not sums and ratios of determinate parts but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limits (limites</em>)&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of sums and ratios</em>. It may be objected that vanishing magnitudes do not have a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">final ratio,&nbsp;</em>because the ratio before it vanishes is not final, and when it has vanished is no longer a ratio. But by the ratio of vanishing magnitudes is to be understood not the ratio&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">before which and after which&nbsp;</em>they vanish, but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with which&nbsp;</em>they vanish.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">(quacum evanescunt</em>). Similarly, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first&nbsp;</em>ratio of nascent magnitudes is that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with which&nbsp;</em>they become.</p>

However, what has been quoted shows that the concept put forward by Newton corresponds to the way in which infinite quantity resulted from the reflection of quantum into itself in the exposition above. By magnitudes is understood magnitudes in their vanishing, i.e. which are no longer quanta; also, not ratios of determinate parts, but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limits of the ratio.&nbsp;</em>The meaning is, therefore, that with the vanishing of the quanta individually, the sides of the ratio, there also vanishes the ratio itself in so far as it is a quantum; the limit of the quantitative ratio is that in which it both is and is not, or, more precisely, in which the quantum has vanished, with the result that the ratio and its sides are preserved, the former only as a qualitative relation of quantity and the latter similarly as qualitative moments of quantity. Newton goes on to add that from the fact that there are final ratios of vanishing magnitudes, it must not be inferred that there are final magnitudes,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indivisibles.&nbsp;</em>For this would mean a leap again from the abstract ratio to its sides as supposedly having an independent value of their own as indivisibles outside their relation, as something which would be a one, something devoid of any relation at all.</p>

In other words,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">final magnitudes&nbsp;</em>could have been taken to mean, as already said, indivisibles or ones. But the definition of the final ratio excludes the conception both of the indifferent one which is devoid of any relation, and of the finite quantum. If the required determination had been developed into the Notion of a quantitative determination which is purely a moment of the ratio, there would have been no need for the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">decreasing without limit&nbsp;</em>into which Newton converts the quantum and which only expresses the progress to infinity, or for the determination of divisibility which no longer has any immediate meaning here.</p>

On the other hand, where the transition is made into the true infinite it is the ratio that is continuous; so&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous&nbsp;</em>is it, so completely is it preserved, that the transition may be said to consist solely in throwing into relief the pure ratio and causing the non-relational determination &mdash; i.e. that a quantum which is a side of the ratio is still a quantum outside this relation &mdash; to vanish. This purification of the quantitative ratio is thus analogous to grasping an empirical reality in terms of its Notion.

A&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">generated magnitude</em>&nbsp;(<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">genita</em>) is a product or quotient, such as a root, rectangle, square, also the sides of rectangles and squares &mdash; in general, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finite magnitude.</em>&nbsp;&#39;Such a magnitude being considered as variable, increasing or decreasing in ceaseless motion and flux, he gives its momentary increments or decrements the name of moments. But these are not to be taken for particles of a definite magnitude&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">(particulae finitae</em>): such would not themselves be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moments&nbsp;</em>but magnitudes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">generated&nbsp;</em>from moments. Rather are they to be understood as the nascent principles&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">or beginnings&nbsp;</em>of finite magnitudes.&#39; Here the quantum is distinguished from itself: as a product or a real being [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Daseiendes</em>], and in its becoming (or as nascent), in its beginning and principle, that is to say, in its Notion, or, what is here the same thing, in its qualitative determination: in the latter the quantitative differences, the infinite increments or decrements, are only moments; only that which has becoming at its back has passed over into the indifference of determinate being and into externality, i.e. is quantum. But if on the one hand the philosophy of the true Notion must acknowledge these determinations of the infinite with respect to increments or decrements, on the other hand it must be observed that the very forms of increments etc. fall&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within&nbsp;</em>the category of immediate quantum and of the continuous progress to which we have referred; in fact the conceptions of increment, growth or increase of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">i</em>, and so on, are to be regarded as the fundamental vice in these methods &mdash; the permanent obstacle to disengaging the determination of the qualitative moment of quantity in its purity from the conception of the ordinary quantum.</p>

With Leibniz, this demand to neglect is more strikingly prominent than with previous inventors of methods relating to these infinitesimals in which this call to neglect also occurs. It is chiefly this call to neglect which, along with a gain in facility, has given this calculus the appearance of inexactitude and express incorrectness in its method of procedure. Wolf has tried to make this neglect intelligible in his own way of popularising things, i.e. by polluting the pure Notion and setting in its place incorrect sensuous conceptions. For example, he compares the neglect of infinitesimals of higher orders relatively to lower with the procedure of a surveyor who, in measuring the height of a mountain is no less accurate if meanwhile the wind has blown away a grain of sand from the top; or with the neglect of the height of houses or towers when calculating lunar eclipses.</p>

And it is self-evident that an absolutely exact result could not emerge from an inexact method. Yet on the other hand again, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">method itself&nbsp;</em>cannot do without this omission of what is regarded as insignificant, despite its protestations against the way this omission is justified. And this is the difficulty which engages the efforts of the analysts to make intelligible and to remove the inherent inconsistency.</p>

He adopts the general Newtonian definition and insists that the differential calculus considers the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ratios of the increments&nbsp;</em>of a magnitude, but that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite difference&nbsp;</em>as such is to be considered as wholly nil. How this is to be understood is clear from the foregoing; the infinite difference is a nil only of quantum, not a qualitative nil, but as a nil of quantum it is a pure moment of the ratio only. It is not a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative&nbsp;</em>difference; but for that reason it is, on the one hand, altogether wrong to speak of those moments which are called infinitesimals, also as increments or decrements and as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">differences.</em>This description implies that something is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">added to or subtracted from&nbsp;</em>the initially given finite magnitude, that a subtraction or addition, an arithmetical, external operation takes place. But it is to be noticed that the transition of the function of the variable magnitude into its differential is of a quite different nature; as we have made clear, it is to be considered as a reduction of the finite function to the qualitative relation of its quantitative determinations. On the other hand, the error becomes obvious when it is said that the increments by themselves are zeros, that only their ratios are considered; for a zero no longer has any determinateness at all. This conception then, does get as far as the negative of the quantum and gives definite expression to it, but at the same time it does not grasp this negative in its positive significance of qualitative determinations of quantity which, if they were torn out of the ratio and regarded as quanta, would be only zeros.</p>

And the understanding must, indeed, transcend this merely negative side on which the terms of the ratio are quantitatively zero, and must grasp them positively, as qualitative moments. But we cannot regard, as satisfactory Euler&#39;s further remarks with regard to this conception of his in which he tries to show that two so-called infinitesimals which are supposed to be nothing else but zeros, nevertheless stand in a relation to each other, for which reason they are denoted by symbols other than zero. He tries to base this on the difference between the arithmetical and geometrical ratio: in the former, we have an eye to the difference, in the latter, to the quotient, so that although in the former there is no difference between two zeros, this is not so in the geometrical ratio; if 2: 1 = 0 : 0 then from the nature of proportion it follows that, because the first term is twice as great as the second, the third is also twice as great as the fourth; thus according to proportion, 0 : 0 is to be taken as the ratio of 2 : 1. Even in common arithmetic n. 0 = 0 and therefore n : 1 = 0 : 0. But it is just because 2 : 1 or n : 1 is a relation of quanta that there cannot be any corresponding ratio or expression of 0 : 0.</p>

Consequently, in the actual application of the method of infinitesimals, the genuine Notion of the infinite cannot exercise any influence; on the contrary, there is a return of the finite determinateness of quantity and the operation cannot dispense with the conception of a quantum which is merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relatively small. The</em>&nbsp;calculus makes it necessary to subject the so-called infinitesimals to ordinary arithmetical operations of addition and so on, which are based on the nature of finite magnitudes, and therefore to regard them momentarily as finite magnitudes and to treat them as such. It is for the calculus to justify its procedure in which it first brings them down into this sphere and treats them as increments or differences, and then neglects them as quanta after it had just applied forms and laws of finite magnitudes to them.</p>

He also gives it as his opinion that in this method, the differential calculus loses its own peculiar advantages, namely simplicity of method and facility of operation. This is, indeed, a procedure which in some measure corresponds to the starting-point of Descartes&#39; tangential method of which detailed mention will be made later. This much, we may remark here, is generally evident, that the general procedure in which different values of variable magnitudes are assumed and subsequently equated, belongs to another department of mathematical treatment than that to which the method of the differential calculus itself belongs; and that the peculiar nature of the simple relation (to be considered in detail further on) to which its actual, concrete determination reduces, namely, of the derived function to the original, is not brought into prominence.</p>

This is for them the sole basis of the fundamental principle, namely the determination of that which is the differential of a product or a power,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for the entire theoretical teaching reduces to this.&nbsp;</em>The rest is partly the mechanism of development and partly application, in which however as we shall later on see, the more important, or rather the sole, interest is to be found. With respect to the present topic, we need only mention here what is elementary, that on the same ground of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">insignificance,&nbsp;</em>the cardinal principle adopted in relation to curves is that the elements of the curves, namely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">increments</em>of abscissa and ordinate, have the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation</em>&nbsp;to each other of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subtangent and ordinate;&nbsp;</em>for the purpose of obtaining similar triangles, the arc which forms the third side of a triangle to the two increments of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">characteristic triangle</em>&nbsp;(as it rightly used to be called), is regarded as a straight line, as part of the tangent and one of the increments therefore as reaching to the tangent. By these assumptions those determinations are, on the one hand, raised above the nature of finite magnitudes, but on the other hand, a method which is valid only for finite magnitudes and which does not permit the omission of anything on the ground of insignificance, is applied to moments now called infinitesimal. With such a mode of procedure, the difficulty which encumbers the method remains in all its starkness.</p>

He finds the differentials of products &mdash; from which the differentials of quotients, powers, etc., can then be easily derived &mdash; in the following way. The product of x and y, when each is taken as reduced by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">half&nbsp;</em>of its infinitesimal difference, becomes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">xy</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">xdy</em>/2 -&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ydx</em>/2 +&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dxdy</em>/4; but if&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>&nbsp;are made to increase by the same amount, it becomes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">xy</em>&nbsp;+ xdy/2 +&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ydx</em>/2 +&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dxdy</em>/4. Now when the first product is subtracted from the second,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ydx + xdy</em>&nbsp;remains as a surplus and this is said to be the surplus of the increase by a whole dx and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy,&nbsp;</em>for this increase is the difference between the two products; it is therefore the differential of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">xy.&nbsp;</em>Clearly, in this procedure, the term which forms the chief difficulty, the product of the two infinitesimal differences, cancels itself out. But in spite of the name of Newton it must be said that such an operation although very elementary, is incorrect; it is not true that (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>/2) (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y&nbsp;</em>+&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>/2) - (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x - dx</em>/2) (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>/2)&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">=&nbsp;</em>(<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>) (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>) -&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">xy.&nbsp;</em>It can only have been the need to establish the all-important fluxional calculus which could bring a Newton to deceive himself with such a proof.</p>

Lagrange shows that Newton made the mistake because he omitted the term of the series containing that power on which the specific problem turned. Newton had kept to the formal, superficial principle of omitting terms on account of their relative smallness. For example, it is well known that in mechanics the terms of the series in which the function of a motion is developed are given a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific meaning,&nbsp;</em>so that the first term or the first function refers to the moment of velocity, the second to the accelerating force and the third to the resistance of forces. Here, then, the terms of the series are not to be regarded merely as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">parts&nbsp;</em>of a sum, but rather as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative moments Of a whole determined by the concept.&nbsp;</em>In this way, the omission of the rest of the terms belonging to the spuriously infinite series acquires an altogether different meaning from omission on the ground of their relative smallness.</p>

The advantages of his functional calculus as regards precision, abstraction and generality, are sufficiently recognised; we need mention only what is pertinent here, that it rests on the fundamental principle that the difference, without becoming zero, can be assumed so small that each term of the series is greater than the sum of all the following terms. This method, too, starts from the categories of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">increment&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference&nbsp;</em>of the function, the variable magnitude of which receives&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the increment,&nbsp;</em>thereby bringing in the troublesome series of the original function; also in the sequel the terms to be omitted are considered only as constituting a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum,&nbsp;</em>while the reason for omitting them is made to consist in the relativity of their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantum.&nbsp;</em>And so here, too, on the one hand, the principle of the omission is not brought back to the point of view exemplified in some applications, where (as was remarked above) terms of the series are supposed to have a specific&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quality&nbsp;</em>significance, and terms are neglected not because of their quantitative insignificance but because they are not qualitatively significant; and then, on the other hand, the omission itself has no place in the essential point of view which, as regards the so-called differential coefficient, only becomes specifically prominent with Lagrange, in the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">application</em>&nbsp;of the calculus, as will be more fully considered in the following remark.</p>

Lagrange criticises this method as lacking case in application and he claims that the expression limit does not present any definite idea; this second point we will take up here and examine more closely what is stated about its analytical meaning. Now the idea of limit does indeed imply the true category of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitatively&nbsp;</em>determined relation of variable magnitudes above-mentioned; for the forms of it which occur,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy,&nbsp;</em>are supposed to be taken simply and solely as moments of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy/dx</em>, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy/dx</em>&nbsp;itself must be regarded as a single indivisible symbol.</p>

Now the said limit is to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limit&nbsp;</em>of a given function; it is to assign to this function a certain value determined by its mode of derivation. But with the mere category of limit we should not have advanced beyond the scope of this Remark, which is to demonstrate that the infinitely small which presents itself in the differential calculus as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy,</em>does not have merely the negative, empty meaning of a non-finite, non-given magnitude, as when one speaks of &#39;an infinite multitude&#39;, &#39;to infinity&#39;, and the like, but on the contrary has the specific meaning of the qualitative nature of what is quantitative, of a moment of a ratio as such. This category, however, merely as such, still has no relation to that which is a given function and does not itself enter into the treatment of such a function or into the use to be made of that determination; thus the idea of limit, too, confined to this its demonstrated character, would lead nowhere. But the very expression &#39;limit&#39; implies that it is a limit of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something, i.e.</em>&nbsp;that it expresses a certain value which lies in the function of a variable magnitude; and we must examine the nature of this concrete role. It is supposed to be the limit of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ratio&nbsp;</em>between the two&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">increments&nbsp;</em>by which the two variable magnitudes connected in an equation (one of which is regarded as a function of the other), are supposed to have been&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">increased;&nbsp;</em>the increase is taken here as quite undetermined and so far no use is made of the infinitely small. But the way in which this limit is found involves the same inconsistencies as are contained in the other methods. This way is as follows: if&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y&nbsp;</em>=<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&nbsp;fx</em>, then when y becomes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y + k, fx&nbsp;</em>is to change into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fx + ph + qh</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">rh</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">3</sup>&nbsp;and so on; thus<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">k = ph + qh<sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>,&nbsp;</em>etc., and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">k</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">h</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p + qh + rh</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>, etc. Now if&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">k</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">h</em>&nbsp;vanish, the right-hand side of the equation also vanishes with the exception of p; now p is supposed to be the limit of the ratio of the two increments. It is clear that while h, as a quantum, is equated with 0,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">k</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">h</em>&nbsp;nevertheless is not at the same time equal to 0/0 but is supposed still to remain a ratio.</p>

The more precise meaning of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">approximation&nbsp;</em>with respect to the terms which are supposed really to approach each other will be considered later. But that a quantitative difference, the definition of which is that it not only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">can, but shall&nbsp;</em>be smaller than any given difference, is no longer a quantitative difference, this is self-evident, as self-evident as anything can be in mathematics; but we still have not got away from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy/dx</em>&nbsp;= 0. If on the other hand&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy/dx</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p</em>, i. e. is assumed to be a definite quantitative ratio as in fact it is, then conversely there is a difficulty about the presupposition which equates h with o, a presupposition which is indispensable for obtaining the equation&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">k</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">h</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p</em>.

To this there is at once an obvious answer, the simple, meagre answer that it is a coefficient derived in such and such a way &mdash; the first function, derived in a certain specific manner, of an original function. if we content ourselves with this &mdash; and Lagrange did, in fact, do so in practice &mdash; then the general part of the science of the differential calculus, and straightway this one particular form of it called the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">theory of limits&nbsp;</em>would be rid of the increments and of their infinite or arbitrary smallness &mdash; spared too, the difficulty of getting rid again of all the terms of a series other than the first, or rather only the coefficient of the first, which inevitably follow on the introduction of these increments; in addition it would also be purged of those formal categories connected with them, especially of the infinite, of infinite approximation and, too, the categories, here equally empty, of continuous magnitude&#39; which, moreover, like&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nisus,&nbsp;</em>becoming, occasion of a variation, are deemed necessary.</p>

As we have seen, it is in this that the entire nature of the matter consists. Thus in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">final ratio,&nbsp;</em>for example, the quanta of abscissa and ordinate vanish; but the sides of this ratio essentially remain, the one an element of the ordinate, the other an element of the abscissa. This vanishing being represented as &#39; an infinite approximation, the previously distinguished ordinate is made to pass over into the other ordinate, and the previously distinguished abscissa into the other abscissa; but essentially this is not so, the ordinate does not pass over into the abscissa, neither does the abscissa pass into the ordinate. To continue with this example of variable magnitudes, the element of the ordinate is not to be taken as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference of one ordinate from another ordinate,&nbsp;</em>but rather as the difference or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative</em>&nbsp;determination of magnitude relatively to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">element o the abscissa;</em>&nbsp;the principle of the one variable magnitude relatively to that of the other is in reciprocal relation with it. The difference, as no longer a difference of finite magnitudes, has ceased to be manifold within itself; it has collapsed into a simple intensity, into the determinateness of one qualitative moment of a ratio relatively to the other.</p>

And so the limit here does not have the meaning of ratio; it counts only as the final value to which another magnitude of a similar kind continually approximates in such a manner that it can differ from it by as little as we please, and that the final&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ratio&nbsp;</em>is a ratio of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equality.&nbsp;</em>The infinite difference is thus the fluctuation of a difference of one quantum from another quantum, and the qualitative nature according to which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>&nbsp;is essentially not a determination of the ratio relatively to x, but to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy,&nbsp;</em>comes to be overlooked.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Dx</em>&nbsp;is permitted to vanish relatively to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>, but even more does&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>&nbsp;vanish relatively to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>; but this means in truth: it has a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation only to dy.&nbsp;</em>In such expositions, geometricians are mainly concerned to make intelligible the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">approximation&nbsp;</em>of a magnitude to its limit and to keep to this aspect of the difference of quantum from quantum, how it is no difference and yet still is a difference. But all the same, approximation is a category which of itself says nothing and explains nothing; dx already has approximation behind it; it is neither near nor nearer; and &#39;infinitely near&#39;, itself means the negation of nearness and approximation.</p>

From this would follow the inadmissible idea that it is allowed in the final ratio to equate, say abscissa and ordinate, or even sine, cosine, tangent, versed sine, and what not. This idea seems at first to prevail when the arc is treated as a tangent; for the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">arc,&nbsp;</em>too, is certainly incom<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mensurable&nbsp;</em>with the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">straight line,&nbsp;</em>and its element is, in the first place, of another&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quality&nbsp;</em>than the element of the straight line. It seems even more absurd and inadmissible than the confusing of abscissa, ordinate, versed sine, cosine, etc., when&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quadrata rotundas,&nbsp;</em>when part of an arc, even though an infinitely small part, is taken to be a part of the tangent and so treated as a straight line. However, this treatment differs essentially from the confusion we have decried; it is justified by the circumstance that in the triangle which has for its sides the element of an arc and the elements of its abscissa and ordinate, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation is the same as</em>&nbsp;if this element of the arc were the element of a straight line, of the tangent; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">angles&nbsp;</em>which constitute the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential relation, i.e.</em>&nbsp;that which remains to these elements when abstraction is made from the finite magnitudes belonging to them, are the same. This can also be expressed as the transition of straight lines which are infinitely small, into curved lines, and their relation in their infinity as a relation of curves. Since, according to its definition, a straight line is the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">shortest&nbsp;</em>distance between two points, its difference from the curved line is based on the determination of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount,&nbsp;</em>on the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">smaller</em>amount of what is differentiated in this manner, a determination, therefore, of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantum.&nbsp;</em>But this determination vanishes in the line when it is taken as an intensive magnitude, as an infinite moment, as an element, and with it, too, its difference from the curved line which rested merely on the difference of quantum. As infinite, therefore, the straight line and arc no longer retain any quantitative relation nor consequently, on the basis of the assumed definition, any qualitative difference from each other either; on the contrary, the former passes into the latter.</p>

This proposition is the expression in words of what is supposed to be the significance of an analytical term obtained in the above-mentioned development of the formula relating to a motion which is non-uniform but otherwise conforms to a law. Earlier mathematicians sought to express in words and propositions and to exhibit in geometrical tables the results of the newly invented infinitesimal calculus (which moreover always had to do with concrete objects), chiefly in order to use them for theorems susceptible of the ordinary method of proof. The terms of a mathematical formula into which analytical treatment resolved&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the magnitude&nbsp;</em>of the object, of motion, for instance, acquired there an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objective&nbsp;</em>significance, such as velocity, force of acceleration, and so on; in accordance with this meaning they were supposed to furnish correct propositions, physical laws; their objective connections and relations, too, were supposed to be determined in accordance with the analytical connection. A particular example is that in a uniformly accelerated motion there is supposed to exist a special velocity proportional to the times, but that to this velocity there constantly accrues an increment from the force of gravity.</p>

The difficulty of making intelligible the connection of such forms when they are taken in the real meaning alluded to, for example the transition from said simply uniform velocity to a uniformly accelerated velocity, is held to be completely eliminated by the analytical treatment in which such connection is a simple result of the authority now established once and for all of the operations of the calculus. It is announced as a triumph of science that by means of the calculus alone, laws are found<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transcending experience,&nbsp;</em>that is, propositions about existence which have no existence. But in the earlier, still naive period of the infinitesimal calculus, the aim was to assign to those forms and propositions represented in geometrical diagrams a real meaning of their own and to make that meaning plausible, and to apply the forms and propositions bearing such meaning in the proof of the main propositions concerned.</p>

The desire to uphold the honour of mathematics, that all its propositions ought to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">rigorously proved,&nbsp;</em>has often caused it to forget its limits; thus it seemed against its honour to acknowledge simply experience as the source and sole proof of empirical propositions. Consciousness has since then developed a more instructed view of the matter; so long, however, as consciousness is not clearly aware of the distinction between what is mathematically demonstrable and what can come only from another source, between what are only terms of an analytical expansion and what are physical existences, scientific method cannot be developed into a rigorous and pure attitude in this field. Without doubt, however, the same justice will be done to that framework of Newtonian proof as was done to another baseless and artificial Newtonian structure of optical experiments and conclusions derived from them. Applied mathematics is still full of a similar concoction of experiment and reflection; but just as one part after another of Newtonian optics long since began to be ignored in practice by the science &mdash; with the inconsistency however that all the rest although in contradiction was allowed to stand &mdash; so, too, it is a fact that already some of those illusory proofs have fallen into oblivion or have been replaced by others.</p>

The so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">application,&nbsp;</em>however, presents greater difficulties, but also the more interesting side; the elements of this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete&nbsp;</em>side are to be the object of this Remark. The whole method of the differential calculus is complete in the proposition that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dxn = nx</em>(<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">n</em>&nbsp;- 1)<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>, or (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">f</em>(<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x + i</em>)&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">- fx</em>)/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">i&nbsp;</em>=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">P</em>, that is, is equal to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">coefficient&nbsp;</em>of the first term of the binomial&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x + d</em>, or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x +&nbsp;</em>1, developed according to the powers of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx or&nbsp;</em>i. There is no need to learn anything further: the development of the next forms, of the differential of a product, of an exponential magnitude and so on, follows mechanically; in little time, in half an hour perhaps &mdash; for with the finding of the differential the converse the finding of the original function from the differential, or integration, is also given &mdash; one can be in possession of the whole theory. What takes longer is simply the effort to understand, to make intelligible, how it is that, after having so easily accomplished&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the first stage&nbsp;</em>of the task, the finding of the said differential, analytically, i.e. purely arithmetically, by the expansion of the function of the variable after this has received the form of a binomial by the addition of an increment; how it is that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">second stage&nbsp;</em>can be correct, namely the omission of all the terms except the first, of the series arising from the expansion. If all that were required were only this coefficient, then with its determination all that concerns the theory would, as we have said, be settled and done with in less than half an hour and the omission of the further terms of the series (with the determination of the first function, the determination of the second, third, etc., is also accomplished) far from causing any difficulty, would not come into question since they are completely irrelevant.</p>

Not only was it not invented for its own sake as another mode of analytical procedure; on the contrary, the arbitrary omission of terms arising from the expansion of a function is absolutely contrary to all mathematical principles, it being arbitrary in the sense that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">whole&nbsp;</em>of this development is nevertheless assumed to belong&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">completely&nbsp;</em>to the matter in hand, this being regarded as the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference&nbsp;</em>between the developed function of a variable (after this has been given the form of a binomial) and the original function. The need for such a mode of procedure and the lack of any internal justification at once suggest that the origin and foundation must lie elsewhere. It happens in other sciences too, that what is placed at the beginning of a science as its elements and from which the principles of the science are supposed to be derived is not self-evident, and that it is rather in the sequel that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">raison d&#39;&eacute;tre&nbsp;</em>and proof of those elements is to be found. The course of events in the history of the differential calculus makes it plain that the matter had its origin mainly in the various so-called tangential methods, in what could be considered ingenious devices; it was only later that mathematicians reflected on the nature of the method after it had been extended to other objects, and reduced it to abstract formulae which they then also attempted to raise to the status of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">principle</em>.</p>

This was done only in the interest of the abstract nature of the notion as such; the next question would be as to the nature of the transition from this to the mathematical formulation and application. To this end we must first pursue our examination of the theoretical side, the specific nature of the notion, which will not prove wholly unfruitful in itself; we must then consider the relation of the theoretical side to its application; and in both cases we must demonstrate, so far as it is relevant here, that the general conclusions are at the same time adequate to the purpose of the differential calculus and to the way in which the calculus brings about its results.</p>

The specifically qualitative character of quantity is first indicated in the quantitative&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>as such; but it was already asserted in anticipation when demonstrating the so-called kinds of reckoning (see the relative Remark), that it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation of powers</em>(still to be dealt with in its proper place) in which number, through the equating of the moments of its Notion, unit and amount, is posited as returned into itself, thereby receiving into itself the moment of infinity, of being-for-self, i.e. of being self-determined. Thus, as we have already said, the express qualitative nature of quantity is essentially connected with the forms of powers, and since the specific interest of the differential calculus is to operate with qualitative forms of magnitude, its own peculiar subject matter must be the treatment of forms of powers, and the whole range of problems, and their solutions, show that the interest lies solely in the treatment of determinations of powers as such.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">This foundation is important and at once puts in the forefront something definite in place of the merely formal categories of variable, continuous or infinite magnitudes or even of functions generally; yet it is still too general, for other operations also have to do with determinations of powers. The raising to a power, extraction of a root, treatment of exponential magnitudes and logarithms, series, and equations of higher orders, the interest and concern of all these is solely with relations which are based on powers. Undoubtedly, these together constitute a system of the treatment of powers; but which of the various relations in which determinations of powers can be put is the peculiar interest and subject matter of the differential calculus, this is to be ascertained from the calculus itself, i.e. from its so-called applications. These are, in fact, the core of the whole business, the actual procedure in the mathematical solution of a certain group of problems; this procedure was earlier than the theory or general part and was later called application only with reference to the subsequently created theory, the aim of which was to draw up the general method of the procedure and, as well, to endow it with first principles, i.e. with a justification. We have shown in the preceding Remark the futility of the search for principles which would clarify the method as currently understood, principles which would really solve the contradiction revealed by the method instead of excusing it or covering it up merely by the insignificance of what is here to be omitted (but which really is required by mathematical procedure), or, by what amounts to the same thing, the possibility of infinite or arbitrary approximation and the like. If from the practical part of mathematics known as the differential calculus the general features of the method were to be abstracted in a manner different from that hitherto followed, then the said principles and the concern about them would also show themselves to be superfluous, just as they reveal themselves to be intrinsically false and permanently contradictory.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;"><span class="pointa" style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">(a)</span>&nbsp;Equations in which any number of magnitudes (here we can simply confine ourselves to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">two</em>) are combined into a qualitative whole in such a way that first, these equations have their determinateness in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">empirical magnitudes&nbsp;</em>which are their fixed limits, and also in the kind of connection they have with these limits and with each other as is generally the case in an equation; but since there is only one equation for both magnitudes (similarly, relatively more equations for more magnitudes, but always fewer than the number of magnitudes), these equations belong to the class of indeterminate equations; and secondly, that one aspect of the determinateness of these magnitudes is that they are &mdash; or at least one of them is present in the equation in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">higher power&nbsp;</em>than the first.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">Before proceeding further, there are one or two things to be noticed about this. The first is that the magnitudes, as described under the first of the above two headings, have simply and solely the character of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">variables&nbsp;</em>such as occur in the problems of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indeterminate</em>analysis. Their value is undetermined, but if one of them does receive a completely determined value, i.e. a numerical value, from outside, then the other too, is determined, so that one is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">function&nbsp;</em>of the other. Therefore, in relation to the specific quantitative determinateness here in question, the categories of variable magnitudes, functions and the like are, as we have already said, merely formal, because they are still too general to contain that specific element on which the entire interest of the differential calculus is focused, or to permit of that element being explicated by analysis; they are in themselves simple, unimportant, easy determinations which are only made difficult by importing into them what they do not contain in order that this may then be derived from them &mdash; namely, the specific determination of the differential calculus. Then as regards the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">constant,&nbsp;</em>we can note that it is in the first place an indifferent empirical magnitude determining the variables only with respect to their empirical quantum as a limit of their minimum and maximum; but the nature of the connection between the constants and the variables is itself a significant factor in the nature of the particular function which these magnitudes are. Conversely, however, the constants themselves are also functions; in so far as a straight line, for example, has the meaning of being the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">parameter&nbsp;</em>of a parabola, then this meaning is that it is the function&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>; and in the expansion of the binomial generally, the constant which is the coefficient of the first term of the development is the sum of the roots, the coefficient of the second is the sum of the products, in pairs, and so on; here, therefore, the constants are simply functions of the roots. Where, in the integral calculus, the constant is determined from the given formula, it is to that extent treated as a function of this. Further on we shall consider these coefficients in another character than that of functions, their meaning in the concrete object being the focus of the whole interest.</p>

For this reason it should be noted, in criticism of another formalism, that the first power is only a power in relation to higher powers;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">on its own, x&nbsp;</em>is merely any indeterminate quantum. Thus there is no point in differentiating for their own sakes the equations&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y = ax + b&nbsp;</em>(of the straight line), or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">s = ct</em>&nbsp;(of the plain uniform velocity); if from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y = ax,&nbsp;</em>or even&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ax + b,&nbsp;</em>we obtain&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>, or from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">s = ct, ds</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dt = c</em>, then&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x&nbsp;</em>is equally the determination of the tangent, or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">s</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">t</em>&nbsp;that of velocity simply as such. The latter is given the form of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx</em>&nbsp;in the context of what is said to be the development of the uniformly accelerated motion; but, as already remarked, the presence in the system of such a motion, of a moment of simple, merely uniform velocity, i.e. a velocity which is not determined by the higher power of one of the moments of the motion is itself an empty assumption based solely on the routine of the method. Since the method starts from the conception of the increment which the variable is supposed to acquire, then of course a variable which is only a function of the first power can also receive an increment; when now in order to find the differential we have to subtract the difference of the second equation thus produced from the given equation, the meaninglessness of the operation becomes apparent, for, as we have remarked, the equation for the so-called increments, both before and after the operation, is the same as for the variables themselves.</p>

This consideration can yield only known results, in a form found especially in Lagrange&#39;s version; but I have made the exposition completely elementary in order to eliminate the heterogeneous determinations associated with it. The basis of treatment of an equation of this kind shows itself to be this, that the power is taken as being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within itself</em>a relation or a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">system of relations</em>. We said above that power is number which has reached the stage where it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determines its own alteration,&nbsp;</em>where its moments of unit and amount are identical &mdash; as previously shown,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">completely</em>&nbsp;identical first in the square,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">formally</em>(which makes no difference here) in higher powers. Now power is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">number&nbsp;</em>(magnitude as the more general term may be preferred, but it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>always number), and hence a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plurality,&nbsp;</em>and also is represented as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum;</em>&nbsp;it can therefore be directly analysed into an arbitrary amount of numbers which have no further determination relatively to one another or to their sum, other than that together they are equal to the sum. But the power can also be split into a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum&nbsp;</em>of differences which are determined by the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form of the power.&nbsp;</em>If the power is taken as a sum, then its radical number, the root, is also taken as a sum, and arbitrarily after manifold divisions, which manifoldness, however, is the indifferent, empirically quantitative element. The sum which the root is supposed to be, when reduced to its simple determinateness, i.e. to its genuine universality, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">binomial;&nbsp;</em>all further increase in the number of terms is a mere<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">repetition&nbsp;</em>of the same determination and therefore meaningless.</p>

It was said that the variable into the determination of which power enters is regarded as within itself a sum, in fact a system of terms in so far as these are functions of the potentiation, and that thus the root, too, is regarded as a sum and in the simply determined form of a binomial:<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">n</sup>&nbsp;= (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">z</em>)<sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">n</sup>&nbsp;= (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">n</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ny</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">(<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">n</em>-1)</sup><em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">z&nbsp;</em>+ ... ). This exposition started from the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum&nbsp;</em>as such for the expansion of the power, i.e. for obtaining the functions of its potentiation; but what is concerned here is not a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum&nbsp;</em>as such, or the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">series</em>&nbsp;arising from it; what is to be taken up from the sum is only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation</em>. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>as such of the magnitudes is, on the one hand, all that remains after abstraction is made from the plus of a sum as such, and on the other hand, all that is needed for finding the functions produced by the expansion of the power.</p>

In this complex, each of these variables is posited simply as in<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>to the others with the meaning, one could say, of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plus&nbsp;</em>implicit in it &mdash; as a function of the other variables; their character, that of being functions of one another, gives them this determination of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plus&nbsp;</em>which, however, for that same reason, is wholly<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indeterminate &mdash; not&nbsp;</em>an increase or an increment, or anything of that nature. Yet even this abstract point of view we could leave out of account; we can quite simply stop at the point where the variables in the equation having received the form of functions of one another, such functions containing a relation of powers, the functions of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">potentiation are</em>&nbsp;then also compared with one another &mdash; these second functions being determined simply and solely by the potentiation itself.

But the so-called increment is supposed to be not a quantum but only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a form,&nbsp;</em>the whole value of which is that it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">assists&nbsp;</em>the development; it is admitted &mdash; most categorically by Euler and Lagrange and in the previously mentioned conception of limit &mdash; that what is wanted is only the resulting power determinations of the variables, the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">coefficients,&nbsp;</em>namely, of the increment and its powers, according to which the series is ordered and to which the different coefficients belong. On this we could perhaps remark that since an increment (which has no quantum) is assumed only for the sake of the development, it would be most appropriate to take i (the one) for that purpose, for in the development this always occurs only as a factor; the factor one, therefore, fulfils the purpose, namely, that the increment is not to involve any quantitative determinateness or alteration; on the other hand,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx,&nbsp;</em>which is burdened with the false idea of a quantitative difference, and other symbols like i with the mere show &mdash; pointless here &mdash; of generality, always have the appearance and pretension of a quantum and its powers; which pretension then involves the trouble that they must nevertheless be removed and left out. In order to retain the form of a series expanded on the basis of powers, the designations of the exponents as indices could equally well be attached to the one. But in any case, abstraction must be made from the series and from the determination of the coefficients according to their place in the series; the relation between all of them is the same; the second function is derived from the first in exactly the same manner as this is from the original function, and for the function counted as second, the first derived function is itself original. But the essential point of interest is not the series but simply and solely the determination of the power resulting from the expansion in its relation to the variable which for the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">power determination is immediate.&nbsp;</em>It should not therefore be defined as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">coefficient</em>&nbsp;of the first term of the development, for it is first only in relation to the other terms following it in the series, and a power such as that of an increment, like the series itself, is here out of place; instead, the simple expression: derived function of a power, or as was said above: function of potentiation of a magnitude, would be preferable &mdash; the knowledge of the way in which the derivation is taken to be a development included within a power being presupposed.</p>

This operation is therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">applicable&nbsp;</em>in the case of those objects in which there is also present such a difference of power determinations. Now if we reflect on the specific nature of space, we find that it contains the three dimensions which, in order to distinguish them from the abstract differences of height, length and breadth, we can call concrete &mdash; namely, line, surface and total space; and when they are taken in their simplest forms and with reference to self-determination and consequently to analytical dimensions, we have the straight line, plane surface and surface taken as a square, and the cube. The straight line has an empirical quantum, but with the plane there enters the qualitative element, the determination of power; further modifications, e.g. the fact that this also happens in the case of plane curves, we need not consider, for we are concerned primarily with the distinction in general. With this there arises, too, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">need to pass from a higher power to a lower, and vice versa,&nbsp;</em>when, for example, linear determinations are to be derived from given equations of the plane, or vice versa. Further, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">motion&nbsp;</em>in which we have to consider the quantitative relation of the space traversed to the time elapsed, manifests itself in the different determinations of a motion which is simply uniform, or uniformly accelerated, or alternately uniformly accelerated and uniformly retarded, and thus a self-returning motion; since these different kinds of motion are expressed in accordance with the quantitative relation of their moments, of space and time, their equations contain different determinations of powers, and when it is necessary to determine one kind of motion, or a spatial magnitude to which one kind of motion is linked, from another kind of motion, the operation also involves the passage from one power-function to another, either higher or lower. These two examples may suffice for the purpose for which they are cited.</p>

It will be sufficient here to refer to Barrow, to him who was Newton&#39;s teacher. In his&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">lect. Opt. et Geom.,&nbsp;</em>in which he treats problems of higher geometry according to the method of indivisibles, a method which, to begin with, is distinct from the characteristic feature of the differential calculus, he also puts on record&#39; his procedure for determining tangents &mdash; &#39;because his friends urged him to do so&#39;. To form a proper idea of how this procedure is formulated simply as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external rule,&nbsp;</em>in the same style as the &#39;rule of three&#39;, or better still the so-called &#39;test by casting out nines&#39;, one must read Barrow&#39;s own exposition. He draws the tiny lines afterwards known as the increments in the characteristic triangle of a curve and then gives the instruction, in the form of a mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">rule, to reject as superfluous&nbsp;</em>the terms which, as a result of the expansion of the equations, appear as powers of the said increments or as products (<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">etenim isti termini nihilum valebunt</em>); similarly, the terms which contain only magnitudes to be found in the original equation are to be rejected (the subsequent subtraction of the original equation from that formed with the increments); and finally, for the increments of the ordinate and abscissa, the ordinate itself and the subtangent respectively are to be substituted. The procedure, if one may say so, can hardly be set forth in a more schoolmaster-like manner; the latter substitution is the assumption of the proportionality of the increments of the ordinate and the abscissa with the ordinate and the subtangent, an assumption on which is based the determination of the tangent in the ordinary differential method; in Barrow&#39;s rule this assumption appears in all its naive nakedness. A simple way of determining the subtangent was found; the artifices of Roberval and Fermat have a similar character. The method for finding maximal and minimal values from which Fermat started rests on the same basis and the same procedure. It was a mathematical craze of those times to find so-called<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">methods,&nbsp;</em>i.e. rules of that kind and to make a secret of them &mdash; which was not only easy, but in one respect even necessary, for the same reason that it was easy &mdash; namely, because the inventors had found only an empirical, external rule, not a method, i.e. nothing derived from established principles. Leibniz accepted such so-called methods from his contemporaries and so did Newton who got them directly from his teacher; by generalising their form and applicableness they opened up new paths for the sciences, but at the same time they also felt the need to wrest free the procedure from the shape of merely external rules and to try to procure for it the necessary justification.</p>

Now the equation represents a curve; but this relation, which is completely dependent on it and derived from it (above, according to a mere rule), is, on the contrary, a linear relation with which certain lines are in proportion:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p</em>&nbsp;: 2<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a - x</em>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y&nbsp;</em>are themselves relations of straight line of the curve, of the co-ordinates and parameters.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">But with all this, nothing is as yet known.&nbsp;</em>The interest centres on finding that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">derived relation&nbsp;</em>applies to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>lines connected with the curve, on finding the equality of two relations. And so there is, secondly, the question, which are the straight lines determined by the nature of the curve, standing in such a relation? But this is just what&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">was already known:&nbsp;</em>namely, that the relation so obtained is the relation of the ordinate to the subtangent. This the ancients had found in an ingenious geometrical manner; what the moderns have discovered is the empirical procedure of so preparing the equation of the curve that it yields that first relation of which it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">was already known&nbsp;</em>that it is equal to a relation containing the line (here the subtangent) which is to be determined. Now on the one hand, this preparation of the equation &mdash; the differentiation &mdash; has been methodically conceived and executed; but on the other hand the imaginary increments of the co-ordinates and an imaginary characteristic triangle formed by them and by an equally imaginary increment of the tangent, have been invented in order that the proportionality of the ratio found by lowering the degree of the equation to the ratio formed by the ordinate and subtangent, may be represented, not as something only empirically accepted as an already familiar fact, but as something demonstrated. However, in the said form of rules, the already familiar fact reveals itself absolutely and unmistakably as the sole occasion and respective justification of the assumption of the characteristic triangle and the said proportionality.</p>

We have to thank his method for bringing into prominence the real point of interest for it consists in separating the two transitions necessary for the solution of the problem and treating and proving each of them separately. One part of this solution (for the more detailed statement of the process we shall confine ourselves to the example of the elementary problem of finding the subtangent), the theoretical or general part, namely, the finding of the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first function&nbsp;</em>from the given equation of the is dealt with separately; the result is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">linear relation</em>, a curve, relation therefore of straight lines occurring in the system determined by the curve. The other part of the solution now is the finding of those lines in the curve which stand in this relation. Now this is effected in a direct manner i.e., without the characteristic triangle, which means that there is no assumption of infinitely small arcs, ordinates and abscissae, the last two being given the significance of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx,&nbsp;</em>that is, of being sides of that relation, and at the same time directly equating the infinitely small ordinate and abscissa with the ordinate and subtangent themselves. A line (and a point, too), is determined only in so far as it forms the side of a triangle and the determination of a point, too, falls only in such triangle. This, it may be mentioned in passing, is the fundamental proposition of analytical geometry from which are derived the co-ordinates of that science, just as (it is the same standpoint) in mechanics it gives rise to the parallelogram of forces, for which very reason the many efforts to find a proof of this latter are quite unnecessary. The subtangent, now, is made to be the side of a triangle whose other sides are the ordinate and the tangent connected to it. The equation of the latter, as a straight line, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p = aq&nbsp;</em>(the determination does not require the additional term, + b which is added only on account of the fondness for generality); &mdash; the determination of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ratio&nbsp;</em>p/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">q&nbsp;</em>falls within a, the coefficient of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">q</em>&nbsp;which is the respective first function (derivative) of the equation, but may simply be considered only as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">q&nbsp;</em>being, as we have said, the essential determination of the straight line which is applied as tangent to the curve. But the first function (derivative) of the equation of the curve is equally the determination of a straight line; seeing then that the co-ordinate&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p</em>&nbsp;of the first straight line and y, the co-ordinate of the curve, are assumed to be identical (so that the point at which the curve is touched by the first straight line assumed as tangent is also the starting point of the straight line determined by the first function of the curve), the problem is to show that this second straight line coincides with the first, i.e. is a tangent; or, algebraically expressed, that since&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fx&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">p = Fq,&nbsp;</em>and it is assumed that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y = p</em>&nbsp;and hence that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fx = Fq</em>, therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">f&#39;x = F&#39;q.&nbsp;</em>Now in order to show that the straight line applied as a tangent and the straight line determined by the first function of the equation coincide, and that therefore the latter is a tangent, Descartes has recourse to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">increment i&nbsp;</em>of the abscissa and to the increment of the ordinate determined by the expansion of the function. Thus here, too, the objectionable increment also makes its appearance; but its introduction for the purpose indicated and its role in the expansion of the function must be carefully distinguished from the previously mentioned employment of the increment in finding the differential equation and in the characteristic triangle. Its employment here is justified and necessary because it falls within the scope of geometry, the geometrical determination of a tangent as such implying that between it and the curve with which it has a point in common, no other straight line can be drawn which also passes through the said point. For, as thus determined, the quality of tangent or not-tangent is reduced to a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative difference,&nbsp;</em>that line being the tangent of which simply<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">greater smallness&nbsp;</em>is predicated with respect to the determination in point. This seemingly only relative smallness contains no empirical element whatever, i.e. nothing dependent on a quantum as such; in virtue of the nature of the formula it is explicitly qualitative if the difference of the moments on which the magnitude to be compared depends is a difference of powers. Since this difference becomes that of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">i</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">i</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">i</em>&nbsp;(which after all is meant to signify a number) is then to be conceived as a fraction,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">i</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;is therefore in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">itself and explicitly&nbsp;</em>smaller than&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">i</em>, so that the very conception of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">arbitrary&nbsp;</em>magnitude in connection with i is here superfluous and in fact out of place. For the same reason the demonstration of the greater smallness has nothing to do with an infinitesimal, which thus need not be brought in here at all.</p>

Descartes expounds this independent method, in which the required linear determination is likewise found from the same derivative function, in his geometry which has proved to be so fruitful in other respects tool; in it he has taught the great basis of the nature of equations and their geometrical construction, and also of the application of analysis, thereby greatly widened in its scope, to geometry. With him the problem took the form of drawing straight lines perpendicularly to given points on a curve as a method for determining the subtangent, etc. One can understand the satisfaction he felt at his discovery, which concerned an object of general scientific interest at that time and which is so purely geometrical and therefore was greatly superior to the mere rules of his rivals, referred to above. His words are as follows: &#39;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">J&#39;ose dire que c&#39;est ceci le probleme le plus utile et le plus general, non seulement que je sache, mais meme que j&#39;aie l&#39;amais desire de savoir en giometrie.</em>&#39; He bases his solution on the analytic equation of the right-angled triangle formed by the ordinate of the point on the curve to which the required straight line in the problem is to be drawn perpendicularly, by this same straight line (the normal), and thirdly, by that part of the axis which is cut off by the ordinate and the normal (the subnormal). Now from the known equation of a curve, the value of either the ordinate or the abscissa is substituted in the said triangle, the result being an equation of the second degree (and Descartes shows how even curves whose equations contain higher powers reduce to this); in this equation, only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one&nbsp;</em>of the variables occurs, namely, as a square and in the first degree &mdash; a quadratic equation which at first appears as a so-called impure equation. Descartes now makes the reflection that if the assumed point on the curve is imagined to be a point of intersection of the curve and of a circle, then this circle will also cut the curve in another point and we shall then get for the unequal&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em>s thus produced, two equations with the same constants and of the same form, or else only one equation with unequal values of x. But the equation only becomes one for the one triangle in which the hypotenuse is perpendicular to the curve or is the normal, the case being conceived of in this way, that the two points of intersection of the curve and the circle are made to coincide and the circle is thus made to touch the curve. But in that case it is also true that the x or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">y&nbsp;</em>of the quadratic equation no longer have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unequal&nbsp;</em>roots. Now since in a quadratic equation with two equal roots the coefficient of the term containing the unknown in the first power is twice the single root, we obtain an equation which yields the required determinations. This procedure must be regarded as the brilliant device of a genuinely analytical mind, in comparison with which the dogmatically assumed proportionality of the subtangent and the ordinate with the postulated infinitely small, so-called increments, of the abscissa and ordinate drops into the background.</p>

The differentiation of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">- ax</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">b</em>&nbsp;= 0 yields the new equation 2<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x -&nbsp;</em>a = 0; or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">3</sup>&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">- px - q&nbsp;</em>= 0 gives 3<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">x</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">- p</em>&nbsp;= 0. But it suggests itself here to remark that it is by no means self-evident that such a derivative equation is also correct. We have already pointed out that an equation with two variables (which, just because they are variables, do not lose their character of being unknown quantities) yields only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proportion;&nbsp;</em>and for the simple reason stated, namely, that when the functions of potentiation are substituted for the powers themselves, the value of both terms of the equation is altered and it is not yet known whether an equation still exists between them with their values thus altered. All that the equation&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx = P</em>&nbsp;expresses is that P is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ratio&nbsp;</em>and no other real meaning can be ascribed to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dyldx.&nbsp;</em>But even so, we still do not know of this ratio =&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">P</em>, to what other ratio it is equal; and it is only such equation or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proportionality</em>&nbsp;which gives a value and meaning to it. We have already mentioned that this meaning, which was called the application, was taken from another source, empirically; similarly, in the case of the equations here under discussion which have been obtained by differentiation, it is from another source that we must know whether they have equal roots in order that we may learn whether the equation thus obtained is still correct. But this fact is not expressly brought to notice in the textbooks; it is disposed of, certainly, when an equation with one unknown, reduced to zero, is straightway equated with y, with the result, of course, that differentiation yields a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dy</em>/<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx,&nbsp;</em>i.e. only a ratio. The functional calculus, it is true, is supposed to deal with functions of potentiation and the differential calculus with differentials; but it by no means follows from this alone that the magnitudes from which the differentials or functions of potentiation are taken, are themselves supposed to be only functions of other magnitudes. Besides, in the theoretical part, in the instruction to derive the differentials, i.e. the functions of potentiation, there is no indication that the magnitudes which are to be subjected to such treatment are themselves supposed to be functions of other magnitudes.</p>

In the usual exposition, the omission of the so-called constants (which are connected with the other terms only by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plus and minus</em>) results from the mere mechanism of the process of differentiation, in which to find the differential of a compound expression only the variables are given an increment, and the expression thereby formed is subtracted from the original expression. The meaning of the constants and of their omission, in what respect they are themselves functions and, as such, are or are not of service, are not discussed.</p>

To differentiate denotes that differences are posited, whereas the result of differentiating is, in fact, to reduce the dimensions of an equation, and to omit the constant is to remove from the equation an element in its determinateness. As we have remarked, the roots of the variables are made equal, and therefore their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference is cancelled.&nbsp;</em>In integration, on the other hand, the constant must be added in again and although as a result the equation is integrated, it is so in the sense that the previously cancelled&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference&nbsp;</em>of the roots is restored, that is, what was posited as equal is differentiated again. The ordinary expression helps to obscure the essential nature of the matter and to set everything in a point of view which is not only subordinate but even alien to the main interest, the point of view, namely, of the infinitely small difference, the increment and the like, and also of the mere difference as such between the given and the derived function, without any indication of their specific, i.e. qualitative, difference.</p>

But another significance is acquired by the analysis of motion in connection with the determination of its trajectory; if this is a curve and its equation contains higher powers, then transitions are required from rectilinear functions, as functions of potentiation, to the powers themselves; and since the former have to be obtained from the original equation of motion containing the factor of time, this factor being eliminated, the powers must at the same time be reduced to the lower functions of development from which the said linear equations can be obtained. This aspect leads to the interesting feature of the other part of the differential calculus.</p>

Its nature has been found to consist in this, that from an equation of power functions the coefficient of the term of the expansion, the so-called first function, is obtained, and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>which this first function represents is demonstrated in moments of the concrete subject matter, these moments being themselves determined by the equation so obtained between the two relations. We shall also briefly consider the principle of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">integral calculus&nbsp;</em>to see what light is thrown on its specific, concrete nature by the application of the principle. The view of the integral calculus has been simplified and more correctly determined merely by the fact that it is no longer taken to be a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">method of summation&nbsp;</em>in which it appeared essentially connected with the form of series; the method was so named in contrast to differentiation where the increment counts as the essential element. The problem of this calculus is, in the first instance, like that of the differential calculus, theoretical or rather formal, but it is, as everyone knows, the converse of the latter. Here, the starting point is a function which is considered as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">deriv,ed,&nbsp;</em>as the coefficient of the first term arising from the expansion of an equation as yet unknown, and the problem is to find the original power function from the derivative; what would be regarded in the natural order of the expansion as the original function is here derived, and the function previously regarded as derived is here the given, or simply original, function. Now the formal part of this operation seems to have been accomplished already in the differential calculus in which the transition and the relation of the original to the derived function in general has been established. Although in doing this it is necessary in many cases to have recourse to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form of series&nbsp;</em>simply in order to obtain the function which is to be the starting point and also to effect the transition from it to the original function, it is important to remember that this form as such has nothing directly to do with the peculiar principle of integration.</p>

But this now is itself the problem: namely, to find the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">meaning&nbsp;</em>in the above-mentioned sense, possessed by the original function of the given function (regarded as first) of a particular subject matter; it might seem that this doctrine, too, was in principle already finally settled in the differential calculus; but a further circumstance is involved which prevents the matter from being so simple. In the differential calculus, namely, it was found that the linear relation is obtained from the first function of the equation of a curve, so that it is also known that the integration of this relation gives the equation of the curve in the relation of abscissa and ordinate; or, if the equation for the area enclosed by the curve were given, then we should be supposed to know already from the differential calculus that the meaning of the first function of such equation would be that it represented the ordinate as a function of the abscissa, and therefore the equation of the curve.</p>

What is given is, for example, not the equation of an area enclosed by the curve, nor, say, of the figure resulting from its rotation; nor again of an arc of the curve, but only the relation of the abscissa and ordinate in the equation of the curve itself. Consequently, the transitions from those determinations to this equation itself cannot yet be dealt with in the differential calculus; the finding of these relations is reserved for the integral calculus.</p>

Similarly, from an infinitely small element of the arc and the corresponding ordinate and abscissa, the ordinary method forms a right-angled triangle in which the square of the arc element is supposed to be equal to the sum of the squares of the two other infinitely small elements, the integration of this giving the length of the arc itself as a finite quantity.</p>

The aim of the integral calculus is this: when a certain part of a mathematical object (e.g. of a curve) is assumed to be the derived function, which other part of the object is expressed by the corresponding original function? It is known that when the function of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ordinate&nbsp;</em>given by the equation of the curve is taken as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">derived&nbsp;</em>function, the corresponding original function gives the quantitative expression for the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">area&nbsp;</em>of the curve cut off by this ordinate; and, when a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">certain tangential&nbsp;</em>determination is identified with the derived function, the corresponding original function expresses the length of the arc belonging to this tangential determination, and so on. But the method which employs the infinitesimal, and operates with it mechanically, simply makes use of the discovery that these relations &mdash; the one of an original function to its derivative and the other of the magnitudes of two parts or elements of the mathematical object &mdash; form a proportion, and spares itself the trouble of demonstrating the truth of what it simply presupposes as a fact. The singular merit here of mathematical acumen is to have found out from results already known elsewhere, that certain specific aspects of a mathematical object stand in the relationship to each other of the original to the derived function.</p>

But the derived function is not directly given, nor is it at once evident which part or element of the mathematical object is to be correlated with the derived function in order that by reducing this to the original function there may be found that other part or element, whose magnitude is required to be determined. The usual method, as we have said, begins by representing certain parts of the object as infinitely small in the form of derived functions determinable from the originally given equation of the object simply by differentiation (like the infinitely small abscissae and ordinates in connection with the rectification of a curve); the parts selected are those which can be brought into a certain relation (one established in elementary mathematics) with the subject matter of the problem (in the given example, with the arc) this, too, being represented as infinitely small, and from this relation the magnitude required to be known can be found from the known magnitude of the parts originally taken. Thus, in connection with the rectification of curves, the three infinitely small elements mentioned are connected in the equation of the right-angled triangle, while for the quadrature of curves, seeing that area is taken arithmetically to be simply the product of lines, the ordinate and the infinitely small abscissa are connected in the form of a product. The transition from such so-called elements of the area, the arc, etc., to the magnitude of the total area or the whole arc itself, passes merely for the ascent from the infinite expression to the finite expression, or to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum&nbsp;</em>of the infinitely many elements of which the required magnitude is supposed to consist.</p>

It will help to elucidate the nature of the matter in hand if here, too, we indicate the details of his method in one or two examples. The declared object of his method is, precisely, to provide an independent proof of the fact that between particular elements of a mathematical whole, for example, of a curve, there exists a relation of the original to the derived function. Now this proof cannot be effected in a direct manner because of the nature of the relation itself in this domain; in the mathematical object this relation connects terms which are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative&nbsp;</em>distinct, namely, curves with straight lines, linear dimensions and their functions with plane or surface dimensions and their functions, so that the required determination can only be taken as the mean between a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">greater&nbsp;</em>and a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">less.</em>Consequently, there spontaneously enters again the form of an increment with a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plus and minus&nbsp;</em>and the energetic&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&#39;developpons&#39;&nbsp;</em>is here in place; but we have already pointed out that here the increments have only an arithmetical, finite meaning. From the development of the condition that the required magnitude is greater than the one easily determinable limit and smaller than the other, it is then deduced that, e.g. the function of the ordinate is the derived, first function of the function of the area.</p>

The mode of procedure is necessarily analogous to the one just indicated. The principle of Archimedes, that the arc of a curve is greater than its chord and smaller than the sum of the two tangents drawn through the end points of the arc and contained between these points and the point of intersection of the tangents, gives no direct equation, but simply&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">postulates&nbsp;</em>an endless alternation between terms determined as too great or too small, the successive terms always being still too great or too small but within ever narrower limits of inaccuracy; its translation into the modern analytical form, however, takes the form of finding an expression which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">per se&nbsp;</em>a simple fundamental equation.

The infinitesimal signifies, strictly, the negation of quantum as quantum, that is, of a so-called finite expression, of the completed determinateness possessed by quantum as such.

The greatness of the modern invention&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">per se&nbsp;</em>and its capacity to solve previously intractable problems and to treat in a simple manner those previously soluble, is to be ascribed solely to the discovery of the relation of the original to the so-called derived functions and of those parts of a mathematical whole which stand in such a relation.</p>

It was possible to confine our exposition to simple problems and the methods of solving them, it would neither have been expedient as regards the determination of the Notion, which determination is here our sole concern, not would it have lain in the author&#39;s power to have reviewed the entire compass of the so-called application of the differential and integral calculus, and by reference of all the respective problems and their solutions to what we have demonstrated to be the principle of the calculus, to have carried out completely the induction that the application is based upon this principle. But sufficient evidence has been produced to show that just as each particular mode of calculation has as its subject matter a specific determinateness or relation of magnitude, such relation constituting addition, multiplication, the raising to powers and extraction of roots, and operations with logarithms and series, and so on, so too has the differential and integral calculus; the subject matter proper to this calculus might be most appropriately named the relation between a power function and the function of its expansion or potentiation, because this is what is most readily suggested by an insight into the nature of the subject matter.</p>

The differential and integral calculus has, indeed, a more particular interest in common with the form of series namely, to determine those functions of expansion which in the series are called coefficients of the terms; but whereas the calculus is concerned only with the relation of the original function to the coefficient of the first term of its expansion, the series aims at exhibiting in the form of a sum, groups of the terms arranged according to powers which have these coefficients. The infinite which is associated with infinite series, the indeterminate expression of the negative of quantum in general, has nothing in common with the affirmative determination belonging to the infinite of this calculus. Similarly, the infinitesimal in the shape of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">increment,&nbsp;</em>by means of which the expansion is given the form of a series, is only an external means for the expansion, and the sole meaning of its so-called infinity is to have no other meaning beyond its significance as such means; the series, which in fact is not what is wanted, produces an excess, the elimination of which causes the unnecessary trouble. The method of Lagrange, who preferred to use the form of series again, is also burdened with this difficulty; although it is through his method, in what is called the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">application,</em>&nbsp;that what is truly characteristic of the calculus is brought to notice, for, without forcing the forms of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dx, dy&nbsp;</em>and so on,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">into the objects,&nbsp;</em>it is directly demonstrated to which part of the object the determinateness of the derived function (function of expansion) belongs; and thus it is evident that the matter in hand here is not the form of series.</p>

These arithmetical investigations include the rules of differentiation, the derivation of Taylor&#39;s theorem, etc., and even the various methods of integration. But the case is quite the reverse, for it is precisely those applications which form the subject matter of the differential calculus proper, all those arithmetical developments and operations being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposed by the calculus&nbsp;</em>from analysis.&#39; We have shown how, with Lagrange, it is just the separation of the so-called application from the procedure of the general part which starts from series, which serves to bring to notice the characteristic subject matter of the differential calculus. It is strange, however, that the author, who realises that it is just these applications which form the subject matter of the differential calculus proper, should get involved in the formal metaphysics (adduced in that work) of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous magnitude, becoming,&nbsp;</em>flow, etc., and should want to add even fresh ballast to the old; these determinations are formal, in that they are only general categories which do not indicate just what is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific nature&nbsp;</em>of the subject matter, this having to be learned and abstracted from the concrete theory, that is, the applications.]</p>

But in the application to spatial objects, the qualitative determinateness of the analytic relation is fully manifested as the transition from linear to planar determinations, from determinations of straight lines to those of curves, and so on. This application further involves that spatial objects, which by their nature are given in the form of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous</em>magnitudes, are taken to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">discrete,&nbsp;</em>the plane therefore as a multitude of lines, the line as a multitude of points, and so on.</p>

For the problems where the employment of this procedure is chiefly indicated, it is requisite that the element forming the starting point should be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-determined</em>&nbsp;&mdash; in contrast to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indirect&nbsp;</em>method which, on the contrary, can begin only with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limits&nbsp;</em>between which lies the self-determined element as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">goal&nbsp;</em>towards which the method advances. But then the result in both methods comes to the same thing if what can be found is only the law for progressively determining the required magnitude without the possibility of reaching the perfect, that is, so-called finite, determination demanded. To Kepler is ascribed the honour of first having thought of this reversal of the process and of having made the discrete the starting point. His explanation of how he understands the first proposition in Archimedes&#39; cyclometry expresses this quite simply. Archimedes&#39; first proposition, as we know, is that a circle is equal to a right-angled triangle having one of the sides enclosing the right angle equal to the diameter and the other to the circumference of the circle. Now Kepler takes the meaning of this proposition to be that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">circumference&nbsp;</em>of the circle has as many parts as it has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">points,&nbsp;</em>that is, an infinite number, each of which can be regarded as the base of an isosceles triangle, and so on; he thus gives expression to the resolution of the continuous into the form of the discrete. The expression &#39;infinite&#39; which occurs here is still far removed from the definition it is supposed to have in the differential calculus. When now a determinateness a function, has been found for such discrete elements, they are supposed to be summed up, to be essentially elements of the continuous. But since a sum of points does not make a line, or a sum of lines a plane, the points are already directly taken as linear and the lines as planar. But because these linear elements are at the same time supposed not to be lines, which they would be if they were taken as quantum, they are represented as being infinitely small. What is discrete can only be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externally&nbsp;</em>summed up, the moments of such sum retaining the meaning of the discrete one (unit); the analytic transition from these ones is made only to their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum&nbsp;</em>and is not simultaneously the geometrical transition from the point to the line or from the line to the plane and so on; therefore the element which is determined as point or line is at the same time also given the quality of being linear or planar respectively in order that the sum,, as a sum of little lines, may become a line, or as a sum of little planes may become a plane.</p>

Before one could dispense with this expedient, it would have to be possible to show that the analytic procedure itself which appears as a mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">summation, in</em>&nbsp;fact already contains a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">multiplication.&nbsp;</em>But this involves a fresh assumption which forms the basis in this application of arithmetical relations to geometrical figures: the assumption, namely, that arithmetical multiplication is also for the geometrical determination a transition into a higher dimension &mdash; that the arithmetical multiplication of magnitudes spatially determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">lines&nbsp;</em>also produces a plane from the linear determination; three times four linear feet gives twelve linear feet, but three linear feet times four linear feet gives twelve superficial feet and, in fact, square feet, since the unit in both factors as discrete quantities is the same. The multiplication of lines by lines at first sight appears meaningless in so far as multiplication concerns simply numbers, i.e. is an alteration of a subject matter that is perfectly homogeneous with what it passes over into, with the product, only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">magnitude&nbsp;</em>being altered. On the other hand, what was called multiplication of a line as such by a line &mdash; it has been called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ductus lineae in lineam, like plant in planum,&nbsp;</em>and is also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ductus puncti in lineam</em>&nbsp;&mdash; is an alteration not merely of magnitude, but of magnitude as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative</em>determination of spatial character, of a dimension; the transition of the line into a plane must be understood as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-externalisation</em>of the line, and similarly the self-externalisation of the point is a line, and of the plane a whole space [volume]. This is the same as the representation of the line as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">motion&nbsp;</em>of a point, and so forth; but motion includes a determination of time and thus appears in this representation rather as merely a contingent, external alteration of state. The transition must be grasped from the standpoint of the Notion which was expressed as a self-externalisation &mdash; the qualitative alteration which arithmetically is the multiplication of unit (point, etc.) by amount (line, etc.). We may here further remark that with the self-externalisation of the plane, which would appear as a multiplication of the plane by a plane, there is seemingly a difference between the arithmetical and geometrical operations such that the self-externalisation of the plane as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ductus plani in planum&nbsp;</em>would give arithmetically a multiplication of a two-dimensional factor by another such, and consequently a four-dimensional product which, however, is reduced by the geometrical determination to three. Although on the one hand number, because its principle is the one, yields the fixed determination for the external, quantitative element, yet equally, the result of operating with it is formal. Taken as a numerical determination 3 x 3 when it reproduces itself is 3 x 3 x 3 x 3; but this same magnitude as a plane, when it reproduces itself, is restricted to 3 x 3 x 3, because space, represented as an expansion outwards from the point, from the merely abstract limit, has its true limit as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete&nbsp;</em>determinateness beyond the line in the third dimension. The difference referred to could prove itself effective as regards free motion in which one side, the spatial side has a geometrical significance (in Kepler&#39;s law,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">s</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">3</sup>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">t</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>) and the other, the temporal side, is an arithmetical determination.</p>

There, the qualitative element lay in the determinateness of power; here, like the infinitely small, it is only the factor as arithmetically related to the product, or as the point to the line or the line to the plane, and so on. Now the qualitative transition which has to be made from the discrete (into which continuous magnitude is imagined to be resolved), to t e continuous, is effected as a process o summation.</p>

This height is represented as being merely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount</em>&nbsp;of a multitude of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">discrete&nbsp;</em>magnitudes which must be summed up. These magnitudes are lines which lie parallel between the said limiting parallels; there are infinitely many of them for they are supposed to constitute the plane, and yet are lines which therefore, in order to possess the character of a plane, must at the same time be posited with negation. In order to escape the difficulty that a sum of lines is supposed to give a plane, the lines are directly assumed to be planes but also as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinitely narrow,&nbsp;</em>for they have their determination solely in the linear quality of the parallel limits of the trapezium. As parallel and bounded by the other pair of rectilinear sides of the trapezium, these lines can be represented as the terms of an arithmetical progression, having a simply uniform difference which does not, however, require to be determined, and whose first and last terms are these two parallel lines; as we know, the sum of such a series is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">product</em>of the parallels and half the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount or number&nbsp;</em>of terms. This last quantum is called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount or number&nbsp;</em>simply and solely with reference to the conception of infinitely many lines; it is simply the specific magnitude of something which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous</em>&nbsp;&mdash; the height. It is clear that what is called a sum is at the same time a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ductus lineae in lineam, a multiplication&nbsp;</em>of lines by lines, and so according to the above determination the result is something having the quality of a plane. In the simplest case of any rectangle&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">AB,&nbsp;</em>each of the two factors is a simple magnitude; but even in the further, still elementary example of the trapezium, only one of the factors is simple as half of the height. The other, on the contrary, is determined by a progression; it is also linear but its specific magnitude is more complex; and since it can be expressed only by a series, the problem of summing it is called analytical, i.e. arithmetical; but the geometrical moment in it is multiplication, the qualitative element of the transition from the dimension of line to that of plane; the one factor was taken to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">discrete</em>&nbsp;only for the arithmetical determination of the other; by itself it is, like the other, the magnitude of a line.</p>

Those who want to avoid here the representation of an area as a sum of lines resort to the usual, quite unnecessary expedient of making the ordinates into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">trapezia&nbsp;</em>of infinitely small breadth; since the equation is only a proportion, only one of the two linear elements of the plane comes into the comparison. The other, the abscissa axis, is assumed as equal in ellipse and circle, as a factor therefore arithmetically equal to i, and consequently the proportion depends solely on the relation of the one determining moment. The two dimensions are necessary to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">representation&nbsp;</em>of a plane, but the quantitative determination required to be indicated in this proportion affects only the one moment; to be swayed by the representation of a plane, or to help it out by adding the idea of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum&nbsp;</em>to this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one</em>&nbsp;moment, is really to fail to recognise the essential mathematical element here involved.</p>

These indivisibles are lines when he is considering a plane, and squares or plane circles when he is considering a pyramid or a cone, etc. The base line or basic plane which is assumed as determined, he calls the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">regula;&nbsp;</em>it is the constant, and with reference to a series it is its first or last term. The indivisibles are regarded as parallel with the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">regula</em>and therefore as having the same determination as this with respect to the figure. Now Cavalieri&#39;s general fundamental proposition is &#39;that all figures, both plane and solid, are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proportionate&nbsp;</em>to all their indivisibles, these being compared with each other collectively and, if there is a common proportion in the figures, distributively&#39;.&#39; For this purpose, he compares in figures of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">same</em>&nbsp;base and height, the proportions between lines drawn parallel to the base and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equidistant&nbsp;</em>from it; all such lines in a figure have one and the same determination and constitute its whole content. In this way, too, Cavalieri proves for example the elementary proposition that parallelograms of equal height are proportional to their bases; any two lines drawn equidistant from and parallel to the base in both figures are in the same proportion as the base lines and so therefore are the whole figures. The lines do not in fact constitute the whole content of the figure as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous, but</em>&nbsp;only the content in so far as it is to be arithmetically&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determined;</em>&nbsp;it is the line which is the element of the content and through it alone must be grasped the specific nature of the figure.</p>

But in parallelograms of equal height and base, only the latter determinateness is an external limit; the height (not the parallelism as such), on which is based the second main determination of the figures, their proportion, introduces a second principle of determination additional to the external limits. Euclid&#39;s proof of the equality of parallelograms having the same height and base reduces them to triangles, to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous figures limited externally;</em>&nbsp;in Cavalieri&#39;s proof, primarily in that of the proportionality of parallelograms, the limit is simply a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative determinateness as such,&nbsp;</em>which is explicated in every pair of lines drawn at the same distance from each other in both figures. These lines, which are equal or in an equal ratio with the base, taken<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">collectively give</em>&nbsp;figures standing in the same ratio. The conception of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">aggregate</em>&nbsp;of lines is incompatible with the continuity of the figure; the essential determinateness is completely exhausted by a consideration of the lines alone. Cavalieri frequently answers the objection that the conception of indivisibles involves the comparison of lines or planes as if they were infinite in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount;&#39;&nbsp;</em>he makes the correct distinction that he does not compare their amount, which we do not know (and which is, as we have remarked, merely an empty idea assumed in support of the theory), but only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">magnitude,&nbsp;</em>i.e. the quantitative determinateness as such which is equal to the space occupied by these lines; because this space is enclosed within limits, its magnitude too is enclosed within the same limits;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the continuous figure is nothing other than the indivisibles themselves,&nbsp;</em>he says; if it were something apart from them it would not be comparable; but it would be absurd to say that bounded continuous figures were not comparable with each other.</p>

The categories he employs in this connection, namely that the continuous is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">composed or consists&nbsp;</em>of indivisibles, and the like, are of course inadequate since they demand at the same time the intuition of the continuous or, as already said, its outer existence; instead of saying that &#39;the continuous is nothing other than the indivisibles themselves&#39;, it would be more correct and also directly self-explanatory to say that the quantitative determinateness of the continuous is none other than that of the indivisibles themselves. Calvalieri does not support the erroneous conclusion that there are greater and lesser infinites which is drawn&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">by the schools&nbsp;</em>from the idea that the indivisibles constitute the continuous; further on&#39; he gives expression to his quite definite awareness that his method of proof by no means forces on him the idea that the continuous is composed of indivisibles; continuous figures follow only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proportion&nbsp;</em>of the indivisibles. He says he has taken the aggregate of indivisibles not as an apparent infinity for the sake of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite&nbsp;</em>number of lines or planes, but in so far as they possess a specific kind of limitedness. But then, in order to remove this stumbling block, he does not spare himself the trouble of proving the principal proportions of his geometry (in the seventh book specially added for this purpose) in a way which remains free from any admixture of infinity. This method reduces the proofs to the usual form of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">coincidence&nbsp;</em>of figures above mentioned, i.e. as remarked, to the conception of determinateness as an external spatial limit.</p>

In the elementary theorems about triangles, two triangles are represented side by side; of their six component parts, three are assumed equal to the corresponding three of the other triangle and it is then shown that such triangles are congruent, i.e. that the remaining three parts of each triangle are also equal to those of the other triangle &mdash; because by virtue of the equality of the first three parts, the triangles&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">coincide.&nbsp;</em>If we take the matter more abstractly, then it is just because of this equality of each pair of corresponding parts in both triangles that there is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one</em>&nbsp;triangle before us; in this it is assumed that three parts are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">already determined&nbsp;</em>and from this follows the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>of the three remaining parts. In this way, the determinateness is exhibited as completed in the three parts; hence for the determinateness as such, the three remaining parts are a superfluity, the superfluity of sensuous existence, i.e. of the intuition of continuity. Expressed in this form, the qualitative determinateness stands out in its distinction from what is given in intuition, from the whole as continuous within itself; the form of coincidence does not bring this distinction to notice.</p>

This gives rise to uncertainty whether in these figures, besides the determinateness of one side, the base, which is an external limit, we are to take for the other determinateness, the other external limit, namely the other side of the parallelogram, or else the height. In the case of two such figures having the same base and height, one of them being rectangular and the other having very acute angles (the opposite angles therefore being very obtuse), the latter triangle can easily look greater than the former, when its long side is taken as the determinant and, as in Cavalieri&#39;s method,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the planes&nbsp;</em>are compared according to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">aggregate&nbsp;</em>of parallel lines intersecting them; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">longer&nbsp;</em>side can be regarded as a potentiality of more lines than is given by the vertical side of the rectangle. Such a conception, however, is no argument against Cavalieri&#39;s method; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">aggregate&nbsp;</em>of parallel lines imagined in the two parallelograms, for the purpose of comparison, also presupposes the equidistance of the lines from each other or from the base; from which it follows that the height, and not the other side of the parallelogram, is the other determining moment. But the case is different again when the comparison is between two parallelograms having the same height and base but not lying in the same plane and making different angles with a third plane; here, the parallel sections which arise, when the third plane is imagined as cutting through the parallelograms and moving parallel to itself are no longer equidistant from each other and the two planes are unequal. Cavalieri is very careful to draw attention to this distinction which he defines as the difference between a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transitus rectus&nbsp;</em>and a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transitus obliquus&nbsp;</em>of the indivisibles and thus prevents a superficial misunderstanding which could arise on this point.&#39; I remember that an objection to indivisibles by Tacquet, an acute geometer who was also working at this time on new methods, concerns this very point: it is referred to in the above-mentioned work of Barrow who also uses the method of indivisibles, although with him it is tainted with the assumption (which he passed on to his pupil Newton and other contemporary mathematicians including Leibniz, too), that a curvilinear triangle, like the so-called characteristic triangle, may be equated with a rectilinear triangle if both are infinitely, that is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">very&nbsp;</em>small.</p>

Tacquet&#39;s objection to the method of indivisibles is that in the calculation of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">surface of</em>&nbsp;a right-angled cone, this atomistic method represents the triangle of the cone to be composed of straight&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">lines&nbsp;</em>parallel to the base and perpendicular to the axis, which are at the same time&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">radii of the circles&nbsp;</em>of which the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">surface&nbsp;</em>of the cone consists. Now if this surface is defined as a sum of the circumferences and this sum is determined from the number of their radii, i.e. from the length of the axis or the height of the cone, then, says Tacquet, such a result clashes with the truth formerly taught and demonstrated by Archimedes. Now Barrow counters this by showing that to determine the surface it is not the axis but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">side&nbsp;</em>of the triangle of the cone which must be taken as the line the revolution of which generates the surface; consequently, it is this line and not the axis which must be assumed as the specific magnitude for the aggregate of the circumferences.</p>

In infinite series, as in Archimedes&#39; cyclometry, the meaning of the infinite is nothing more than this: that the law determining the series being known, but the so-called finite &mdash; i.e. arithmetical &mdash; expression not being given, the reduction of the arc to the straight line cannot be effected; this incommensurability is their qualitative difference. The qualitative difference between the discrete and the continuous generally, equally contains a negative determination which makes them appear as incommensurable and introduces the infinite in the sense that the continuous which is to be taken as discrete, is no longer to possess, as continuous, any quantum. The continuous which is to be taken arithmetically as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">product,</em>&nbsp;is therefore posited as in its own self discrete, i.e. it is analysed into the elements which are its factors and in these lies its quantitative determinateness; just because they are these factors or elements, they are of a lower dimension, and as powers are concerned, are of a lower power than the magnitude of which they are the elements or factors. This difference appears arithmetically as a purely quantitative one, that of the root and power, or whatever degree of powers it may be; however, if the expression is to be taken only quantitatively, for example,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a : a</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">d</em>.<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">=&nbsp;</em>2a :&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>= 2 :&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>, or for the law of descent of a falling body,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">t : a</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>, then it yields the meaningless ratios of 1&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">:&nbsp;</em>a, 2 : a, 1&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">: at</em>; in supersession of their merely quantitative aspect, the sides would have to be held apart by their different qualitative significance, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">s = at</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>, the magnitude in this way being expressed as a quality, as a function of the magnitude of another quality.</p>

It is this that occasions the difficulty, a difficulty which is resolved by an insight into its peculiarity and into the simple nature of the matter; but the introduction of the infinite which is meant to remove the difficulty only serves to aggravate it and prevent its solution.</p>

But they are essentially related to each other not as external quanta, but the determinateness of each consists in this relation to the other. In this their otherness they have thus returned into themselves; what each is, it is in the other; the other constitutes the determinateness of each. The flight of quantum away from and beyond itself has now therefore this meaning, that it changed not merely into an other, or into its abstract other, into its negative beyond, but that in this other it reached its determinateness, finding&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">itself&nbsp;</em>in its beyond, which is another quantum.

When the quantum of one side is determined, the other, too, is determined by the exponent and it is quite immaterial how the first is determined; it no longer has any significance as a determinate quantum on its own, but can equally well be any other quantum without altering the value of the ratio, which depends solely on the exponent.

This quotient therefore is, as exponent, not posited as what it ought to be-the determinant of the ratio, or the ratio&#39;s qualitative unity. It is only posited as this in so far as it has the value of being the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity of both moments,&nbsp;</em>of unit and amount.

As we have already seen, the exponent as immediate could equally well be taken either as unit or as amount; it was then also only a simple quantum and therefore, by choice, an amount; one side was the unit, to be taken as a numerical one, of which the other side is a fixed amount and, at the same time, the exponent; the quality of this latter, therefore, was simply that this quantum is taken as fixed, or rather that this fixed quantum has the meaning only of quantum.</p>

In the direct ratio this unit is only the common element of both sides; as such, it continues itself into the other side, into the amount; and the amount itself taken by itself, or the exponent, is indifferent to the unit.</p>

Consequently, although the exponent is also only an immediate quantum arbitrarily assumed as fixed, it is not preserved as such in the side of the ratio, but this side, and with it the direct ratio of the sides, is alterable. In the ratio, then, as now before us, the exponent as the determining quantum is posited as negative towards itself as a quantum of the ratio, and hence as qualitative, as a limit-with the result that the qualitative moment is manifested independently and in distinct contrast to the quantitative moment. In the direct ratio, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alteration&nbsp;</em>of the two sides is only the one alteration of the quantum which is taken as unit, the common element of both sides; by as many times as the one side is increased or diminished, so also is the other: the ratio itself is not affected by this alteration which is external to it. In the indirect ratio on the other hand, although the alteration, in keeping with the indifferent quantitative moment is also arbitrary, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">confined within the ratio,&nbsp;</em>and this arbitrary quantitative fluctuation, too, is limited by the negative determinateness of the exponent as by a limit.</p>

The indirect or inverse ratio is quantum posited as a qualitative quantum, i.e., displaying itself as self-determining, as a limit of itself within itself. As such, the quantum is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first,&nbsp;</em>an immediate magnitude as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple&nbsp;</em>determinateness, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">whole&nbsp;</em>as a quantum simply affirmatively present. But secondly, this immediate<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>is also a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limit;&nbsp;</em>for that purpose the quantum is differentiated into two quanta which in the first instance are mutually related as others; but the quantum as their qualitative and, moreover, complete determinateness is the unity of unit and amount, a product of which the two quanta are the factors. Thus on the one hand the exponent of their ratio is in them identical with itself and is their affirmative moment which constitutes them quanta; on the other hand the exponent, as the negation posited in them, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>in them, so that although each is in the first place simply an immediate, limited quantum, it is at the same time limited in such a manner that it is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in principle</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an sich</em>] identical with its other. Thirdly, the exponent as the simple determinateness is the negative unity of this differentiation of itself into two quanta and is the limit of their reciprocal limiting.</p>

But it can take from the other only as much as will make its own self equal to this in-itself; it has its maximum in the exponent which in accordance with the stated second determination is the limit of their reciprocal limiting. And since each is a moment of the ratio only in so far as it limits the other and is simultaneously limited by it, it loses this its determination in making itself equal to its in-itself; for in so doing not only does the other magnitude become zero, but it vanishes itself, since what it is supposed to be is not a mere quantum as such, but only quantum as such moment of a ratio. Thus each side is the contradiction between its determination as the in-itself, i.e. as unity of the whole, which is the exponent, and its determination as moment of the ratio; this contradiction is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinity&nbsp;</em>again in a fresh, peculiar form.</p>

This infinity, then, to which these quanta can only approximate is likewise&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affirmatively&nbsp;</em>present and actual-the simple quantum of the exponent. In it is reached the beyond with which the sides of the ratio are burdened; it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly</em>the unity of both, and so implicitly the other side of each; for each has only as much value as the other has not, the whole determinateness of each thus resides in the other, and this their in-itself as an affirmative infinity is simply the exponent.</p>

This consisted in an immediate quantum being also related to another quantum in such a way that its increase is proportional to the decrease of the other, that it is what it is through a negative relationship with the other; also, a third magnitude is the common limit of this their fluctuating increase. This fluctuation here is their distinctive character - in contrast to the qualitative moment as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fixed&nbsp;</em>limit; they have the character of variable magnitudes, for which the said fixed limit is an infinite beyond.</p>

The general result can be indicated by saying that the whole, as exponent, is the limit of the reciprocal limiting of both terms and is therefore posited as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation of the negation,&nbsp;</em>hence as infinity, as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affirmative&nbsp;</em>relation to itself. More specifically the exponent, simply as product, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>the unity of unit and amount, but as each term is only one of these two moments, the exponent also includes them within itself and in them is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly</em>&nbsp;related to itself. But in the inverse ratio, the difference has developed into the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality&nbsp;</em>of quantitative being, and the qualitative moment is not merely the fixity of the exponent, or merely the immediate inclusion in it of the two moments of unit and amount, but is the identification of the exponent with itself in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-external otherness.&nbsp;</em>It is this determination which stands out as result in these moments as explicated. The exponent, namely, is found to be the in-itself which is realised in the simple alterableness of its moments as quanta; the indifference of their magnitudes in their alteration is displayed as an infinite progress, the basis of which is that in their indifference their determinateness is to have their value in the value of the other. Hence [a], in accordance with the affirmative aspect of the quantum, each is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly the</em>&nbsp;whole of the exponent. Similarly [b], the quanta have for their negative moment, for their reciprocal limiting, the magnitude of the exponent; their limit is that of the exponent. The fact that they no longer have any other immanent limit, a fixed immediacy, finds expression in the infinite progress of their determinate being and of their limitation, in the negation of every particular value. This negation is, accordingly, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation&nbsp;</em>of the self-externality of the exponent which is displayed in the moments of the ratio; and the exponent, which is itself a simple quantum and is also differentiated into quanta, is, therefore, posited as preserving itself and uniting with itself in the negation of the indifferent existence of the quanta, thus being the determinant of its self-external otherness.</p>

This is the case in the ratio of powers where the unit, which in its own self is amount, is also amount relatively to itself as unit. The otherness, the amount of units, is the unit itself. The power is a plurality of units each of which is this same plurality. The quantum as an indifferent determinateness undergoes alteration; but in so far as this alteration is a raising to a power, this its otherness is limited purely by itself. Thus in the power, quantum is posited as returned into itself; it is at once its own self and also its otherness.</p>

As a direct ratio it is at first only the simple or unmediated form of such posited difference, so that its self-relation which it has as exponent, in contrast to its differences, counts only as the fixity of an amount of the unit. In the inverse ratio, the quantum is negatively determined as relating itself to itself-to itself as a negation of itself in which, however, it has its value; as an affirmative relation to itself it is an exponent which, as quantum, is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in principle&nbsp;</em>the determinant of its moments. But in the ratio of powers, quantum is present in the deference as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its own difference from itself.

But quantity is not only a quality; it is the truth of quality itself, the latter having exhibited its own transition into quantity. Quantity, on the other hand, is in its truth the externality which is no longer indifferent but has returned into itself. It is thus quality itself in such a manner. that apart from this determination there would no longer be any quality as such. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positing&nbsp;</em>of the totality requires the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">double&nbsp;</em>transition, not only of the one determinateness into its other, but equally the transition of this other, its return, into the first.

It was shown that the chief obstacle to a grasp of the Notion of this infinite is the stopping short at its merely negative determination as the negation of quantum, instead of advancing to the simple affirmative determination which is the qualitative moment. The only further remark to be made here concerns the intrusion of quantitative forms into the pure qualitative forms of thought in philosophy. It is the relationship of powers in particular which has been applied recently to the determinations of the Notion. The Notion in its immediacy was called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the first power or potence;&nbsp;</em>in its otherness or difference, in the determinate being of its moments, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">second power;&nbsp;</em>and in its return into itself or as a totality, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">third power.&nbsp;</em>It is at once evident that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">power&nbsp;</em>as used thus is a category which essentially belongs to quantum &mdash; these powers do not bear the meaning of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">potentia,</em>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dynamis</em>&nbsp;of Aristotle. Thus, the relationship of powers expresses determinateness in the form or difference which has reached its truth, but difference as it is in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">particular Notion&nbsp;</em>of quantum, not as it is in the Notion as such. In quantum, the negativity which belongs to the nature of the Notion is still far from being posited in the determination proper to the Notion; differences which are proper to quantum are superficial determinations for the Notion itself and are still far from being determined as they are in the Notion. It was in the infancy of philosophic thinking that numbers were used, as by Pythagoras, to designate universal, essential distinctions - and first and second power, and so on are in this respect not a whit better than numbers. This was a preliminary stage to comprehension in the element of pure thought; it was not until after Pythagoras that thought determinations themselves were discovered, i.e., became on&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">their own account</em>&nbsp;objects for consciousness. But to retrogress from such determinations to those of number is the action of a thinking which feels its own incapacity, a thinking which, in Opposition to current philosophical culture which is accustomed to thought determinations, now also makes itself ridiculous by pretending that this impotence is something new, superior, and an advance.</p>

If this is done, then they themselves are superfluous designations; the determinateness of the Notion specifies its own self and its specification alone is the correct and fitting designation. The use of those forms is, therefore, nothing more than a convenient means of evading the task of grasping the determinations of the Notion, of specifying and of justifying them.</p>

The first is being, the one, substance, the infinite, essence; in contrast to this abstraction the second, namely, all determinateness in general, what is only finite, accidental, perishable, non-essential, etc. can equally abstractly be grouped together; and this is what usually happens as the next step in quite formal thinking. But the connection of this second with the first is so evident that one cannot avoid grasping it as also in a unity with the latter; thus with Spinoza, the attribute is the whole substance, but is apprehended by the intellect which is itself a limitation or mode; but in this way the mode, the non-substantial generally, which can only be grasped through an other, constitutes the other extreme to substance, the third generally. Indian pantheism, too, in its monstrous fantasies has in an abstract way received this development which runs like a moderating thread through its extravagances; a point of some interest in the development is that Brahma, the one of abstract thought, progresses through the shape of Vishnu, particularly in the form of Krishna, to a third form, that of Siva. The determination of this third is the mode, alteration, coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be-the field of externality in general. This Indian trinity has misled to a comparison with the Christian and it is true that in them a common element of the nature of the Notion can be recognised; but it is essential to gain a more precise consciousness of the difference between them; for not only is this difference infinite, but it is the true, the genuine infinite which constitutes it. This third principle is, according to its determination, the dispersal of the unity of substance into its opposite,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not the return of the unity to itself</em>&nbsp;&mdash; not spirit but rather the non-spiritual. In the true trinity there is not only unity but union, the conclusion of the syllogism is a unity possessing&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content and actuality,&nbsp;</em>a unity which in its wholly concrete determination is spirit. This principle of the mode and of alteration does not, it is true, altogether exclude the unity; in Spinozism, for example, it is precisely the mode as such which is untrue; substance alone is true and to it everything must be brought back. But this is only to submerge all content in the void, in a merely formal unity lacking all content. Thus Siva, too, is again the great whole, not distinct from Brahma, but Brahma himself. In other words, the difference and the determinateness only vanish again but are not preserved, are not sublated, and the unity does not become a concrete unity, neither is the disunity reconciled. The supreme goal for man placed in the sphere of coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be, of modality generally, is submergence in unconsciousness, unity with Brahma, annihilation; the Buddhist Nirvana, Nibbana etc., is the same.</p>

Spinoza&#39;s mode, like the Indian principle of change, is the measureless. The Greek awareness, itself still indeterminate, that everything has a measure &mdash; even Parmenides, after abstract being, introduced necessity as the ancient limit by which all things are bounded &mdash; is the beginning of a much higher conception than that contained in substance and in the difference of the mode from substance.</p>

Measure, it is true, is an external kind and manner of determinateness, a more or less, but at the same time it is equally reflected into itself, a determinateness which is not indifferent and external but intrinsic; it is thus&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the concrete truth of being.&nbsp;</em>That is why mankind has revered measure as something inviolable and sacred.</p>

In measure, the qualitative moment is quantitative; the determinateness or difference is indifferent and so is no difference, is sublated. This nature of quantity as a return-into-self in which it is qualitative constitutes that being-in-and-for-itself which is essence. But measure is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>or in its Notion essence; this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>of measure is not yet posited. Measure, still as such, is itself the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">seiende</em>] unity of quality and quantity; its moments are determinately present as a quality, and quanta thereof; these moments are at first inseparable only in principle [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an sich</em>], but do not yet have the significance of this reflected determination. The development of measure contains the differentiation of these moments, but at the same time their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation,&nbsp;</em>so that the identity which they are in<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&nbsp;themselves&nbsp;</em>becomes their relation to each other, i.e. is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited.&nbsp;</em>The significance of this development is the realisation of measure in which it posits itself as in relation with itself, and hence as a moment. Through this mediation it is determined as sublated; its immediacy and that of its moments vanishes; they are reflected. Measure, having thus&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">realised&nbsp;</em>its own Notion, has passed into essence.</p>

Starting from immediate, external measure it should, on the one hand, go on to develop the abstract determination of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative&nbsp;</em>aspects of natural objects (a mathematics of nature), and on the other hand, to indicate the connection between this determination of measure and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualities&nbsp;</em>of natural objects, at least in general; for the specific proof, derived from the Notion of the concrete object, of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">connection&nbsp;</em>between its qualitative and quantitative aspects, belongs to the special science of the concrete. Examples of this kind concerning the law of falling bodies and free, celestial motion will be found in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Encyclopedia. of the Phil. Sciences,&nbsp;</em>3rd ed., Sections 267 and 270, Remark. In this connection the general observation may be made that the different forms in which measure is realised belong also to different spheres of natural reality. The complete, abstract indifference of developed measure, i.e. the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">laws&nbsp;</em>of measure, can only be manifested in the sphere of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mechanics&nbsp;</em>in which the concrete bodily factor is itself only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract</em>&nbsp;matter; the qualitative differences of such matter are essentially quantitatively determined; space and time are the purest forms of externality, and the multitude of matters, masses, intensity of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">weight,&nbsp;</em>are similarly external determinations which have their characteristic determinateness in the quantitative element. On the other hand, such quantitative determinateness of abstract matter is deranged simply by the plurality of conflicting qualities in the inorganic sphere and still more even in the organic world. But here there is involved not merely a conflict of qualities, for measure here is subordinated to higher relationships and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immanent development&nbsp;</em>of measure tends to be reduced to the simple form of immediate measure. The limbs of the animal organism have a measure which, as a simple quantum, stands in a ratio to the other quanta of the other limbs; the proportions of the human body are the fixed ratio of such quanta. Natural science is still far from possessing an insight into the connection between such quantities and the organic functions on which they wholly depend. But the readiest example of the reduction of an immanent measure to a merely externally determined magnitude&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is motion.&nbsp;</em>In the celestial bodies it is free motion, a motion which is determined solely by the Notion and whose quantitative elements therefore equally depend solely on the Notion (see above); but such free motion is reduced by the living creature to arbitrary or mechanically regular, i.e. a wholly abstract, formal motion.</p>

At first, as an immediate measure it is an immediate quantum, hence just some specific quantum or other; equally immediate is the quality belonging to it, some specific quality or other. The quantum as this no longer indifferent limit but as a self-related externality, is thus itself quality, and although distinguished from it does not transcend it, neither does the quality transcend the quantum. It is thus the determinateness which has returned into simple identity with itself, one with the specific determinate being, just as this latter is one with its quantum.</p>

Everything that exists has a magnitude and this magnitude belongs to the nature of the something itself ; it constitutes its specific nature and its being-within-self. Something is not indifferent to this magnitude, so that if this were altered it would continue to be what it is; on the contrary, an alteration of the magnitude would alter the quality of the something. Quantum, as measure, has ceased to be a limit which is no limit; it is now the determination of the thing, which is destroyed if it is increased or diminished beyond this quantum.</p>

Such a unit can, it is true, also be in fact an intrinsically determinate unit, like a foot and suchlike original measures; but in so far as it is also used as a standard for other things it is in regard to them only an external measure, not their original measure. Thus the diameter of the earth or the length of a pendulum may be taken, each on its own account, as a specific quantum; but the selection of a particular fraction of the earth&#39;s diameter or of the length of the pendulum, as well as the degree of latitude under which the latter is to be taken for use as a standard, is a matter of choice. But for other things such a standard is still more something external. These have further specified the general specific quantum in a particular way and have thereby become particular things. It is therefore foolish to speak of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">natural&nbsp;</em>standard of things. Moreover, a universal standard ought only to serve for<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>comparison; in this most superficial sense in which it is taken as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal measure&nbsp;</em>it is a matter of complete indifference what is used for this purpose. It ought not to be a fundamental measure in the sense that it forms a scale on which the natural measures of particular things could be represented and from which, by means of a rule, they could be grasped as specifications of a universal measure, i.e. of the measure of their universal body. Without this meaning, however, an absolute measure is interesting and significant only as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">common element,&nbsp;</em>and as such is a universal not in itself but only by agreement.</p>

As a quantum it is an indifferent magnitude open to external determination and capable of increase and decrease. But as a measure it is also distinguished from itself as a quantum, as such an indifferent determination, and is a limitation of that indifferent fluctuation about a limit.</p>

An answer in the negative can be given without hesitation since such a removal constitutes only a quantitative difference, a difference moreover which is itself quite insignificant; thus a hair, a grain, is removed and this is repeated, only one of them being removed each time in accordance with the answer given. At last the qualitative change is revealed; the head or the tail is bald, the heap has disappeared. In giving the said answer, what was forgotten was not only the repetition, but the fact that the individually insignificant quantities (like the individually insignificant disbursements from a fortune)&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">add up&nbsp;</em>and the total constitutes the qualitative whole, so that finally this whole has vanished; the head is bald, the purse is empty.</p>

The measurable something has in it this side of being-for-other to which the indifferent increasing and decreasing is proper. This immanent measuring standard is a quality of the something to which is opposed the same quality in another something; but in the latter something the quality is at first only relative, the quantum having no significance as a measure in relation to the other something which is determined as the standard of measuring.</p>

This&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specifically assimilated</em>&nbsp;amount is itself a quantum which is also dependent on the other, or is for it only an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>amount.

But as such, it would be nothing but an external quantum; the exponent here must be understood as nothing else but the qualitative moment itself which specifies the quantum as such. As we have already seen, the strictly immanent qualitative form of the quantum is solely its determination as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">power.&nbsp;</em>It must be such a determination which constitutes the ratio and which here, as the intrinsic determination of the quantum, confronts the quantum as externally constituted. The principle of the quantum is the numerical one which constitutes its intrinsic determinedness, and the mode of relation of the numerical one is external; and the alteration which is specified only by the nature of the immediate quantum as such, consists by itself in the addition of such a numerical one and then another and so on. If in this way the alteration of the external quantum is an arithmetical progression, the specifying reaction of the qualitative nature of measure produces another series which is related to the first, increases and decreases with it, but not in a ratio determined by a numerical exponent but in a number of incommensurable ratios, according to a determination of powers.</p>

As a quantum it is an external temperature, and that too, of a body as a general medium, and it is assumed that the alteration of the temperature proceeds on the scale of an arithmetical progression, increasing or decreasing uniformly. On the other hand, the particular bodies in the medium differ in the way they absorb the temperature, for through their immanent measure they determine it as received from outside themselves and the change of temperature in any one of them does not correspond in a direct ratio with that of the medium or of the other bodies among themselves. Different bodies compared at one and the same temperature give the numerical ratios of their specific heats, of their thermal capacities. But the thermal capacities of bodies vary in different temperatures and associated with this is a change in the specific shape. Thus a particular specification is manifested in the increase or decrease of temperature. The ratio of the temperature, taken as external, to the temperature of a specific body which is at the same time dependent on the former temperature, has no fixed exponent; the increase or decrease of this heat does not proceed uniformly with the increase or decrease of the external heat. Here a temperature is assumed which is purely external and whose changes are merely external or purely quantitative. But the temperature is itself the temperature of the air or some other specific temperature. The ratio, therefore, if looked at more closely, would strictly speaking have to be taken not as the ratio of a merely quantitative quantum to a qualitative one, but as the ratio of two specific quanta. In fact, the determining of the specifying ratio has now advanced to the stage where the moments of measure not only consist of a quantitative side and a side qualifying the quantum, both being sides of one and the same quality, but are related to each other as two qualities which are in themselves measures.</p>

This qualitative side thus has a quantum for its presupposition and its starting point. But this quantum is also qualitatively distinguished from the quality itself; this difference between them is now to be posited in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediacy</em>&nbsp;of being as such, in which determination measure still is. The two sides are thus qualitatively related and each is on its own account a qualitative determinate being; and the one quantum which at first was only a formal quantum indeterminate in itself, is the quantum of a something and of its quality, and also &mdash; now that the connection between them is determined as a measure &mdash; the specific magnitude of these qualities. These qualities are related to each other according to their determination as measures which determination is their exponent. But they are already implicitly related to each other in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-for-self&nbsp;</em>of measure; the quantum in its dual character is both external and specific so that each of the distinct quantities possesses this twofold determination and is at the same time inseparably linked with the other; it is in this way alone that the qualities are determined. They are therefore not only simply determinate beings existing for each other but they are posited as inseparable and the specific magnitude connected with them is a qualitative unity &mdash; a single determination of measure in which, in accordance with their Notion, they are implicitly bound up with each other. Measure is thus the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immanent</em>&nbsp;quantitative relationship of two qualities to each other.</p>

In immediate measure this alteration is not yet posited; it is only an arbitrary, single quantum to which a quality is bound. In the specifying of measure (the preceding determination), which is an alteration of the merely external quantum by the qualitative element, there is posited the distinction between the two specific magnitudes and hence generally the plurality of measures in a common, external quantum. It is in this distinguishedness of the quantum from itself that it first shows itself to be a real measure; for it now appears as a determinate being which is both one and the same (e.g. the constant temperature of the medium), and also quantitatively varied (in the different temperatures of the bodies present in the medium). This distinguishedness of the quantum in the different qualities (the different bodies) gives a further form of measure, that in which the two sides are mutually related as qualitatively determinate quanta.

Taken at first simply as specific magnitudes in their ratio as measures, one of them is an amount which increases and decreases in an external arithmetical progression, the other is an amount which is specifically determined by the first, which for it is unit. Now if each were only just a particular quality, that element of difference would be lacking which, with regard to their character as quantities, would indicate which of them was to be taken as merely externally quantitative and which as varying according to the specifying of its magnitude. If, for example, they are related as root and square, it is immaterial which is regarded as increasing or decreasing merely externally in arithmetical progression, and which, on the other hand, as specifically determining the other quantum.</p>

But the immediacy which is thus posited is the negation of the qualitative determination of measure; this has already been demonstrated in respect of the sides of this determination of measure which for that reason appeared as independent qualities. Such negation and the return to the immediate determination of quantity lies in the qualitatively determined relation, for the relation of distinct terms as such implies their correlation as one determinateness which latter, in distinction from the determination of the relation, is here in the sphere of quantity a quantum. As a negation of the distinct qualitatively determined sides, this exponent is a being-for-self or absolute determinedness; but it is such being-for-self only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in principle</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an sich</em>]; as a determinate being it is a simple immediate quantum which is the quotient or exponent of a direct ratio between the sides of the measure, but in general is the unit appearing as empirical, in the quantitative side of measure. In the motion of failing bodies the spaces traversed are proportional to the squares of the elapsed times,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">s = at</em>2. This is the specifically determined relation of space and time, a ratio of powers. The other, the direct ratio, would concern space and time as mutually indifferent qualities; it is supposed to be the ratio of the space traversed to the first unit of time. The same coefficient a remains in all the following units of time &mdash; the unit being an ordinary quantum, while the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amount&nbsp;</em>is determined by the specifying measure. This unit at the same time counts as the exponent of that direct ratio which belongs to the imaginary, spurious velocity i.e. the merely formal velocity which is not specifically determined by the Notion. Such a velocity does not exist here, any more than the one previously mentioned which is supposed to accrue to the falling body at the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">end&nbsp;</em>of a unit of time. That velocity was ascribed to the first unit of time in the motion of a falling body; but this so-called unit of time is itself only an assumed unit and has as such atomic point no real being.</p>

The said empirical quantum is attributed to the force of gravity, on the supposition that this force itself has no connection with the actual specification, with the ratio of powers characteristic of a determination of measure. The<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>moment, that in the motion of a falling body the amount of some fifteen spatial units, taken as feet, is traversed in a unit &mdash; the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first&nbsp;</em>unit &mdash; of time, a second, is an immediate measure, like the measurements of the limbs of the human body, the distances and diameters of the planets and so forth. The determination of such a measure falls elsewhere than in the qualitative measure determination itself, here in the law of descent of a falling body; however, the concrete sciences have so far failed to throw any light on the basis of determination of such numbers, which are only immediate and consequently are the empirical embodiment of a measure. Here we are concerned only with the determinateness specified by the Notion, namely, that the said empirical coefficient constitutes the moment of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-for-self</em>&nbsp;in the measure-determination, and that too only in so far as this moment is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unexplicated</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an sich</em>], and hence an immediacy. The second moment is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">developed</em>&nbsp;side of this being-for-self, the specific measure determinateness of the sides. In the motion of falling, a motion which is still half-conditioned and half-free, gravity, according to this second moment, is to be regarded as a force of nature, so that the relationship expressed by the law of descent of a falling body is determined by the nature of space and time, and consequently the said specification, namely, the ratio of powers, falls within gravity; the above-mentioned simple direct ratio expresses only a mechanical relationship between space and time in the [merely] formal velocity which is externally produced and determined.</p>

This direct ratio is, so to speak, anticipated and assumed as given in the example used of a measure, namely the law of descent of a falling body; but still, as we remarked, it does not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exist&nbsp;</em>in this motion. The fact, however, that the two sides of measure are themselves measures, the one immediate and external, and the other immanently specified, both being contained within the unity of measure itself, means that measure is now further determined,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is realised.&nbsp;</em>As this unity, measure contains the relation in which the magnitudes are determined and posited as differently specified by the nature of the qualities; its determinateness is accordingly wholly immanent and self-subsistent, and has at the same time collapsed into the being-for-self of an immediate quantum, the exponent of a direct ratio. The self-determination of the relation is thus&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negated,&nbsp;</em>for in this its other it has its final, explicit determinateness; and conversely, the immediate measure which is supposed to be in its own self qualitative, possesses in truth such qualitative determinateness only in the other side of the relation. This negative unity is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">real being-for-self</em>, the category of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something&nbsp;</em>as a unity of qualities which are related as measures &mdash; a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">completely self-subsistent&nbsp;</em>something. The two sides which have presented themselves as distinct relations also immediately possess a twofold existence; or, to put it more explicitly, a self-subsistent whole of this kind, just because it is a real being-for-self, is at the same time a repulsion into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">distinct self-subsistent somethings</em>&nbsp;whose qualitative nature and subsistence (materiality) lies in their measure determinateness.</p>

Space and time are also moments of such measures but their relationship no longer depends simply on their own nature because they are now subordinated to further determinations. Among the determining moments in sound, for example, there is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">time&nbsp;</em>in which a number of vibrations occur, and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">spatial</em>&nbsp;element of length and thickness of the vibrating body; but the magnitudes of those ideal moments are determined externally. Space and time are no longer in a relation of powers but in the ordinary direct relation, harmony being reduced to a quite external simplicity of numbers whose relations can be grasped with the utmost ease and hence afford a satisfaction falling entirely within the element of sensation since there is an absence for spirit of figurate conception, fantasy, abstract thought, and the like. In that the sides which now constitute the measure relation are themselves measures, but at the same time real somethings, their measures are, in the first place, immediate measures and as regards their relations, direct relations. It is the inter-relationship of such relations that is now to be considered in its progressive determination.</p>

This specification as an external relating to a plurality of others in general, produces other relations and hence other measures; and the specific self-subsistence does not continue as a single direct relation but passes over into a specific determinateness which is a series of measures. Secondly, the direct relations thus produced are in themselves determinate and exclusive measures (elective affinities); but because the difference between them is also only quantitative, the progressive determination of the relations presents itself as in part a merely externally quantitative development which, however, is also interrupted by qualitative relationships and forms a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nodal line&nbsp;</em>of specific self-subsistent measure relations. Thirdly, however, in this development measure gives place to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">measureless&nbsp;</em>as such, and more specifically to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinity&nbsp;</em>of measure. In this, the self-exclusive and self-subsistent measures are one with each other, and the self-subsistent measure enters into a negative relation with itself.</p>

One of them is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-within-self or inwardness&nbsp;</em>of the something by virtue of which it is a real being-for-self, a material thing (such as, taken intensively, weight, or in its extensive aspect, the multiplicity of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">material&nbsp;</em>parts); the other quality is the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality&nbsp;</em>of this inwardness (the abstract, ideal element of space). These qualities are quantitatively determined and their correlation constitutes the qualitative nature of the material something &mdash; e.g. the ratio of weight to volume: specific gravity. The volume, the ideal aspect, is to be taken as unit, but the intensive aspect, which manifests quantitatively and in comparison with the former as an extensive magnitude, as a plurality of independent ones, is to be taken as amount. The purely qualitative relation of the two specific magnitudes, that is, as a ratio of powers, has vanished, because with the self-subsistence of the material thing immediacy has returned and in this the specific magnitude is an ordinary quantum whose relation to the other side is likewise determined as the ordinary exponent of a direct ratio.</p>

The exponent constitutes the specific intrinsic determinedness, the inner characteristic measure of something; but because this its measure rests on a quantum, it too is only an external, indifferent determinateness, with the consequence that the something, in spite of its inner determination as a measure, is alterable. The other to which it can, as alterable, enter into relation is not a material plurality, quantum in general &mdash; this it can withstand through its specific intrinsic determinedness -but it is a quantum which is at the same time also an exponent of such a specific ratio. Two things with different internal measures stand in relation and enter into combination &mdash; such as two metals of different specific gravities (the combination in question would not be, for example, of a metal and water); but what other kind of homogeneity is required to make possible such a combination will not be considered here. Now on the one hand, each of the two measures, just because it is a measure, preserves itself in the alteration which it ought to suffer through the externality of the quantum, but on the other hand this self-preservation is itself a negative relation towards this quantum, a specification of it; and since the quantum is the exponent of the measure relation, the self-preservation is an alteration of the measure itself and moreover a reciprocal specification.</p>

But this is true only of the weight of the mixture, which is equal to the sum of the weights before the combination; addition applies to that quality which, as a real being-for-self, has acquired a fixed determinate being with a permanent immediate quantum &mdash; the weight of the material thing, or, what counts as the same from the quantitative point of view, the number or amount of material parts. The exponents however are subject to alteration since they are the expression of the qualitative aspect of the compound, of its being-for-self in the form of measure relations; and since the quantum as such suffers contingent external alteration by an increase which is summed, the being-for-self at the same time displays itself as negating this externality. Because this immanent determining of the quantitative element cannot, as we have seen, be manifested in the weight, it displays itself in the other quality which is the ideal side of the relation. From the point of view of sense perception it may appear remarkable that the mixing of two specifically different material substances should be followed by an alteration &mdash; usually a diminution-in the sum of the two volumes, for it is space itself which constitutes the subsistence of matter in its external separated existence. But this subsistence in face of the negativity immanent in the being-for-self lacks intrinsic being, it is subject to alteration. In this manner space is posited as what it truly is, an ideal being.</p>

Its quality is masked in the quantitative element and is thus also indifferent towards the other measure, continuing itself in it and in the newly formed measure. The exponent of the new measure is itself only some quantum or other, an external determinateness, and its indifference finds expression in the fact that the specifically determined thing effects, in association with other such measures, precisely similar neutralizations of the reciprocal measure relations; it is in only one measure relation formed by itself and another specifically determined thing that its specific peculiarity is not expressed.</p>

The self-subsistent measure has the exponent of its intrinsic determinedness only in the comparison with others; its neutrality with the others, however, constitutes its real comparison with them; it is its comparison with them through its own self. But the exponents of these ratios differ and the qualitative exponent of the self-subsistent measure is thus represented as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">series</em>of these&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">different amounts&nbsp;</em>of which it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unit,&nbsp;</em>i.e. as a series whose members are in a specific relationship to others. The qualitative exponent, as one immediate quantum, expresses only one relation. The distinctive character of the self-subsistent measure finds its true expression in the characteristic series of exponents which it, taken as unit, forms with other such self-subsistent measures; for one of these measures when brought into relation with the rest of them and taken as unit forms another series. Now it is the interrelationship of the members of such a series that constitutes the qualitative aspect of the self-subsistent measure.</p>

But in this way these two measures would&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not be comparable,&nbsp;</em>because each is thus regarded as unit with respect to its exponents, and between the two series arising from this relation there is no&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specified difference.&nbsp;</em>The two measures which, as self-subsistent, are supposed to be compared are at first contra-distinguished only as quanta; in order to determine their relation, an independent unit common to them both is required. This specific unit is to be sought, as has been indicated, only in that feature which embodies the specific determinate being of the measures to be compared, i.e. in the ratio which the exponents of the ratios of the members of the series have to each other. This ratio of the exponents themselves is, however, such independent and actually specific unit only in so far as the members of the series together have it as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">constant</em>&nbsp;ratio to both measures; in that way it can be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">their common unit.&nbsp;</em>It is this alone, therefore, which makes it possible to compare the two self-subsistent measures which were assumed to be not reciprocally neutralising measures, but indifferent to each other. Each of them taken separately and apart from the comparison is the unit of the ratio it forms with the opposite members, which are the amounts relatively to that unit and which thus represent the series of exponents. But conversely, this series is the unit for the two measures which when compared with each other are related as quanta; as such they are themselves different amounts of the unit just indicated.</p>

Each of these then is similarly to be taken as unit so that they have a series of exponents in the two, or rather indefinitely many members of the first series which are compared merely among themselves, and these exponents are the numbers resulting from comparison among themselves of the measures just named; and conversely, the comparative numbers of the measures which are now also to be taken singly as self-subsistent are the series of exponents for the members of the first series. In this way, both sides are series in which each number is firstly simply a unit to the opposite series in which it has its self-determined character as a series of exponents; secondly, each number is itself one of the exponents for each member of the opposite series; and thirdly, it is a comparative number for the other numbers of its series and as such amount, which belongs to it also as an exponent, it has its own specifically determined unit in the opposite series.</p>

In measure, however, this external aspect is not merely a quantum and a circle of quanta, but a series of numerical ratios and it is in the entirety of these that the self-determinedness of measure lies. As is the case in the being-for-self of quantum as degree, the nature of the self-subsistent measure is converted into this externality of itself. Its self-relation is in the first place an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>relation and therefore its indifference to an other consists only in the quantum. It is into this externality therefore that its qualitative side falls and its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relationship to its other&nbsp;</em>becomes that quantitative mode of relationship which constitutes the specific determination of this self-subsistent measure, a mode which is determined just as much by the other as by the measure itself; and this other is a series of quanta and the measure is reciprocally a quantum. But this relation in which two specific measures specify themselves in a third something, the exponent, also implies that the one has not passed into the other; that therefore there is not only one negation, but that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">both&nbsp;</em>are posited as negative in the relation, and since in this each preserves itself as indifferent towards the other&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its negation&nbsp;</em>is also in turn&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negated.</em>This their qualitative unity is thus a self-subsistent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exclusive&nbsp;</em>unit. It is only as exclusive that the exponents, which are primarily comparative numbers of the members of the series, have in them their genuinely specific determinateness relatively to one another, and their difference thus acquires a qualitative nature. But this difference has a quantitative basis: first, the self-subsistent measure is related to a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plurality&nbsp;</em>of its qualitatively other side only because in this relationship it is, at the same time, indifferent; secondly, the neutral relationship, in virtue of its quantitative aspect, is now not simply an alteration but is posited as a negation of the negation and as an exclusive unit. Consequently, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affinity&nbsp;</em>of a self-subsistent measure with the measures of the other side is no longer an indifferent relationship but an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">elective affinity.</em></p>

For a chemical substance has its specific determinateness essentially in its relation to its other and exists only as this difference from it. Furthermore, this specific relation is bound up with quantity and is at the same time the relation, not only to a single other but to a series of specifically different others opposed to it. The combinations with this series are based on a so-called affinity with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">every&nbsp;</em>member of the series; but along with this indifference each member is at the same time exclusive towards the others and it is this correlation of opposed determinations which we have still to consider. It is, however, not only in the sphere of chemistry that the specific relation is represented in a circle of combinations; the individual note, too, only has meaning in relationship and combination with another note and with a series of others. The harmony or disharmony in such a circle of combinations constitutes its qualitative nature which is at the same time based on quantitative ratios; these form a series of exponents and are the ratios of the two specific ratios which each of the combined notes is in its own self. The individual note is the key of a system, but again it is equally an individual member in the system of every other key. The harmonies are exclusive elective affinities whose characteristic quality is equally dissolved again in the externality of a merely quantitative progression. What it is, however, that constitutes the principle of a measure for those affinities which (whether chemical or musical or what else) are elective affinities between and in opposition to the others, will be the subject of a further Remark in connection with chemical affinity; but this higher question is very closely bound up with the specific nature of the strictly qualitative aspect and belongs to the particular concrete natural sciences.</p>

In elective affinity as an exclusive, qualitative correlation, the relationship is rid of this quantitative difference. The next determination which offers itself is this; that in accordance with the difference of the amounts, that is, of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">extensive</em>&nbsp;magnitude, of the substances of the one series required for the neutralisation of a substance in the other series, the elective affinity of the latter substance would also be directed towards the substances of the first series with all of which it has an affinity. The exclusion which would thereby be established in the form of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">firmer&nbsp;</em>holding together against other possibilities of combination, would appear, thus transformed, in a proportionately greater&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intensity&nbsp;</em>in virtue of the previously demonstrated identity of the forms of extensive and intensive magnitude, the quantitative determinateness being one and the same in both forms. However, this sudden conversion of the one-sided form of extensive magnitude into its other, intensive form, makes no difference to the nature of the fundamental determination, which is one and the same quantum; consequently, no real exclusion would, in fact, result therefrom and there could take place equally well either only one combination, or a combination of an indefinite number of substances, provided that the portions of them entering into the combination corresponded to the required quantum in accordance with the ratios existing between them.</p>

In this aspect of exclusive relations, numbers have lost their continuity with one another and their fluid combinatory nature; the relationship is one of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more or less,&nbsp;</em>which acquires a negative character and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">preference</em>which one exponent has over another does not remain confined to the quantitative determinateness. But equally, too, there co-exists this other aspect which again makes it a matter of indifference that a substance receives the neutralising quantum from several substances of the opposed series and from each according to its specific ratio relatively to the others; the exclusive, negative relation is thus at the same time adversely affected by the quantitative aspect. The effect of this is an actual conversion of an indifferent, merely quantitative relationship into a qualitative one, and conversely, a transition from a specifically determined relation into a merely external one &mdash; a series of relations which are sometimes of a merely quantitative nature and sometimes are specific relations and measures.</p>

Acids and alkalis or bases generally, appear to be intrinsically determinate things just as they are; but the fact is that they are incomplete elements of bodies, constituents which strictly speaking do not exist for themselves but only as a tendency to get rid of their isolatedness by combining with another constituent. Further, the difference in virtue of which 1 they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistent,&nbsp;</em>does not consist in this immediate quality but in the peculiar quantitative mode of the relationship. This, namely, is not restricted to the chemical opposition of acid and alkali or base in general, but is a specific&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">measure of saturation</em>and consists in the specific determinateness of the quantity of the substances which neutralise each other. This specific quantity required for saturation constitutes the qualitative nature of a substance; it makes it what it is on its own account and the number which expresses this is essentially one of several exponents for an opposed unit. A substance of this kind has a so-called affinity with another. If this connection remained of a purely qualitative nature, then, as in the case of the magnetic poles or positive and negative electricity, the one determinateness would be only the negative of the other and both sides would not at the same time show themselves to be indifferent towards each other. But because the connection has also a quantitative side, each of these substances is capable of neutralising itself with more than one and is not restricted only to the one to which it is opposed. It is not only an acid and an alkali or base which are in relation, but acids and alkalis or bases which are related to one another. They are specifically distinguished from each other primarily according to whether one acid, for example, requires a greater amount of an alkali for its saturation than another acid does. But the independent, self-determined character of the substances is displayed in the exclusiveness of the relation between the affinities, one having a preference over another in that one acid can by itself enter into combination with any alkali, and conversely. Thus the cardinal difference between two acids consists in one of them having a closer affinity to a base than the other, i.e., in a so-called elective affinity.</p>

From this it follows that the amounts of two alkaline bases required for the saturation of an acid must be in the same ratio to saturate another acid; and in general, when for one alkali, taken as unit, the series of numerical ratios has been determined in which the various acids saturate it, then this series is the same for any other alkali, though the different alkalis must be taken in different amounts relatively to one another-amounts which again on their part form a similar fixed series of exponents for each of the opposite acids since they are related to any one acid in the same ratio as to any other. Fischer was the first to extract these series in their simplicity from the works of Richter and Berthollet. Since that was written, our knowledge of the numerical ratios of mixtures of chemical elements has been greatly expanded in every direction and to consider it here would be a digression, all the more so because this empirical expansion which is in part only hypothetical remains confined within the same group of concepts. We may however add a few remarks on the categories employed here and also on the views about chemical elective affinity itself and its relation to the quantitative aspect as well as the attempt to base this on specific physical qualities.</p>

If two acids act on an alkali and the one which has a greater affinity for it is also present in the requisite amount for saturating it, then according to the concept of elective affinity this is the only saturation which occurs; the other acid remains quite inactive and is excluded from the neutral combination. According to the concept of the activity of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">chemical mass,</em>&nbsp;on the other hand, each of the two acids is active in a proportion which is composed of the amounts of the acids present and their saturation capacity or so-called affinity. Berthollet&#39;s investigations have indicated in greater detail the circumstances in which the activity of the chemical mass is nullified and one acid (the one with a stronger affinity) appears to expel and to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exclude&nbsp;</em>the action of the other acid (with a weaker affinity) that is, appears to be active in the sense of elective affinity. He has shown that this exclusion takes place in certain<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">circumstances,&nbsp;</em>such as strength of cohesion, or the insolubility in water of the salts formed, but the qualitative&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nature&nbsp;</em>of the agents as such does not come into play; and the action of these circumstances can in turn be nullified by other circumstances, for example, by temperature. With the removal of these obstacles the chemical mass enters unimpeded into activity and what appeared as a purely qualitative exclusion, as an elective affinity, proves to depend only on external modifications.</p>

Now there we read &#39;that one&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">must imagine&nbsp;</em>that in a uniformly mixed liquid, each atom of the dissolved substance is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">surrounded&nbsp;</em>by an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equal number&nbsp;</em>of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">atoms&nbsp;</em>of the solvent; and if several substances are dissolved together they must&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">share between them the interstices&nbsp;</em>between the atoms of the solvent, so that with a uniform mixture of the liquid there is produced a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">symmetry in the arrangement&nbsp;</em>of the atoms such that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">all the atoms&nbsp;</em>of the individual substances are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">uniformly arranged in relation to the atoms&nbsp;</em>of the other bodies; it could therefore be said that the solution is characterised by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">symmetry in the arrangement&nbsp;</em>of the atoms, and the combination by the fixed proportions.&#39; This is then illustrated by an example of compounds formed when sulphuric acid is added to a solution of copper chloride; but the example certainly does not demonstrate that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">atoms&nbsp;</em>exist; neither does it show that a number of atoms of the dissolved substances&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">surround&nbsp;</em>atoms of the fluid, nor that free atoms of the two acids&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">arrange themselves around&nbsp;</em>the atoms which remain combined (with the copper oxide), nor that there exists a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">symmetry&nbsp;</em>in their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">position and arrangement,&nbsp;</em>nor that interstices between the atoms exist &mdash; and least of all that the dissolved substances&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">share among themselves the interstices&nbsp;</em>between the atoms of the solvent. This would mean that the atoms of the dissolved substances take up their positions where the solvent is not &mdash; for the interstices between the atoms of the solvent are spaces&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">empty&nbsp;</em>of it &mdash; and hence that the dissolved substances are not present in the solvent, but rather&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">are outside&nbsp;</em>it, even if the solvent is arranged around them or they around it, and it is also certain therefore that they are not dissolved by it. One fails therefore to see why it is<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessary&nbsp;</em>to form such conceptions which are not empirically demonstrated, are in essence directly self-contradictory and are not corroborated in any other way. Corroboration could be provided only by a consideration of these conceptions themselves, i.e. by metaphysics, which is logic; but this cannot confirm them any more than experience can &mdash; on the contrary! For the rest, Berzelius admits what was also said above, that Berthollet&#39;s propositions are not opposed to the theory of fixed proportions, although he does add that they are also not opposed to the views of the corpuscular theory, i.e. the ideas mentioned above of atoms, of the filling of the interstices of the solvent by the atoms of the solid substances, and so on; this latter baseless metaphysics however, has essentially nothing to do with the proportions of saturation as such.</p>

When Berzelius, then, notwithstanding the fact that his theory of proportions is wholly and solely a determination of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">amounts,&nbsp;</em>nevertheless also speaks of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degrees&nbsp;</em>of affinity&#39; in explaining Berthollet&#39;s&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">chemical mass&nbsp;</em>as the sum of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degree of affinity,&nbsp;</em>from the given quantity of the active substance &mdash; although Berthollet is more consistent for he uses the expression&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">capacite de saturation &mdash; then&nbsp;</em>he himself lapses into the form of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intensive&nbsp;</em>magnitude; but it is this form which is the characteristic feature of the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dynamic&nbsp;</em>philosophy which earlier on he calls &#39;the speculative philosophy of certain German schools&#39;,&#39; and emphatically rejects in favour of the excellent &#39;corpuscular theory&#39;. He there states of this dynamic philosophy that it assumes that the elements&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">interpenetrate&nbsp;</em>one another in their chemical combination, and that neutralization consists in this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mutual interpenetration;&nbsp;</em>this means nothing else than that the chemically different particles, which are interrelated as a plurality, collapse into the simplicity of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intensive&nbsp;</em>magnitude, a fact which also finds expression as a diminution of volume. In the corpuscular theory, on the other hand, even the atoms which are chemically&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">combined&nbsp;</em>are supposed to be preserved in the interstices, i.e.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside&nbsp;</em>one another (juxtaposition); in such a relationship which is one of merely extensive magnitude, of a perpetuated amount, a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degree&nbsp;</em>of affinity has no meaning. In the same place it is stated that for the dynamic view the phenomena of specific proportions came as something quite unforeseen; but this would be only an external, historical circumstance, apart from the fact that Richter&#39;s stoechiometric series in Fischer&#39;s compilation of them were already known to Berthollet and are quoted in the first edition of this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Logic</em>which proves the nullity of the categories on which the old, like the would-be new, corpuscular theory is based. But Berzelius is in error when he judges that if &#39;the dynamic view&#39; had prevailed, the phenomenaof specific proportions would have remained &#39;for ever&#39; unknown-meaning that this view is incompatible with the determinateness of proportions. This is, in any case, only a determinateness of quantity, no matter whether in an extensive or an intensive form; so that even Berzelius, much as he adheres to the first of these forms, that of aggregate or amount [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Menge</em>], himself makes use of the conception of degrees of affinity.</p>

A partial comparison may be made between this conception and the manner of considering the effect of gravity on a moving pendulum. Through gravity the- pendulum necessarily passes into a state of rest; but this intrinsic effect of gravity itself is treated as a merely concomitant circumstance of the external resistance of the air, the thread and so on, and it is ascribed solely to friction instead of to gravity. Here it makes no difference to the nature of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative&nbsp;</em>element present in elective affinity whether this is manifested in the form of these circumstances taken as its conditions, and is so interpreted.

We need not here consider more closely this theory in which the phenomena of electricity and chemistry are completely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identified,&nbsp;</em>since it concerns the physical nature of substances and not merely their measure relations and it calls for mention only in so far as the distinctive character of the determinations of measure is confused by it. The theory as such must be dubbed shallow, for shallowness consists in omitting the difference between distinct terms and then treating them as identical. As for affinity, chemical processes being thus identified with electrical, and also with the phenomena of fire and light, this is reduced &#39;to neutralisation of opposite electricities. It is almost comical to find the identification of electricity and chemical action expounded in the following manner: &#39;it is true that electrical phenomena explain the action of bodies at a greater or lesser distance, their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">attraction&nbsp;</em>before combination (i.e. a behaviour which is not yet chemical) and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fire</em>(?) caused by this combination, but they throw no light on the cause of the combination which persists with such strength&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">after&nbsp;</em>the opposite electrical condition has been destroyed;&#39; that is to say, the theory tells us that electricity is the cause of the chemical action, but about the specifically chemical nature of the chemical process electricity tells us nothing. Chemical difference as such being thus reduced to the opposition of positive and negative electricity, the different affinities of the agents on either side are determined as the order of two series of electro-posit&#39; e and electro-negative substances. In identifying electricity and chemical action it is overlooked that the former generally (and its neutralisation) is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transient&nbsp;</em>and remains&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>to the quality of substances, whereas chemical action, especially in the process of neutralisation, embraces and alters the entire qualitative nature of substances. Equally transient within electricity is its opposition of positive and negative; this is so unstable that it is dependent on the most trivial outer circumstances and cannot be compared with the definiteness and fixity of the opposition between acids, for example, and metals, and so on.</p>

Also the further distinction&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within the series&nbsp;</em>of each of the two sides, between a more or less positive-electrical or more or less negative-electrical disposition is quite uncertain and entirely unconfirmed. But it is on the basis of the &#39;electrical dispositions&#39; of these series of substances that &#39;the electro-chemical system is to be set up, which above all would be best fitted to provide an idea of chemistry&#39;: these series are now quoted; but what their nature really is, is indicated in the remark &#39;that this is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">approximately&nbsp;</em>the order of these substances, but so little investigation has been made into this matter, that as yet&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing really certain&nbsp;</em>can be ascertained about this relative order. Both the numerical ratios of the series of affinities (first made by Richter) as well as the extremely interesting reduction by Berzelius of the combinations of two substances to the simplicity of a few quantitative ratios, are absolutely independent of that hypothetical electro-chemical hotchpotch. If the experimental method has been the correct guiding star in the theory of proportions and its universal expansion since Richter, then the mixing of these great discoveries with the so-called corpuscular theory, a desert lying away from the path of experience, forms all the greater contrast with it; only this beginning, the abandoning of the principle of experience, could be the reason for taking up again and developing that idea introduced earlier, especially by Ritter, namely, the setting up of fixed classifications of electro-positive and electronegative substances, which classifications were also supposed to have a chemical significance.</p>

It is admitted that two so-called electro-negative substances such as sulphur and oxygen combine in a much more intimate way than, e.g. oxygen and copper, although the latter is electro-positive.2 Here therefore, the basis for the affinity founded on the general opposition of positive and negative electricity must give place to a mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more or less&nbsp;</em>within one and the same series of electrical quality. From this it is now inferred that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degree of affinity</em>&nbsp;of the substances depends therefore not only on their specific&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unipolarity&nbsp;</em>(with what hypothesis this determination is connected is irrelevant here; it is significant here only for the &#39;either&#39; of the positive and the &#39;or&#39; of the negative); the degree of affinity must be derived mainly from the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intensity&nbsp;</em>of their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">polarity&nbsp;</em>generally. At this point then, the consideration of affinity passes on to the relationship of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">elective&nbsp;</em>affinity which is our chief concern; let us see then what the result now is for this subject. It is at once admitted that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degree&nbsp;</em>of this polarity, if this does not exist merely in our imagination, does not seem to be a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">constant quality</em>&nbsp;but to depend very much on temperatures so that, after all, the result turns out to be not only that every chemical action is therefore at bottom an electrical phenomenon, but also that what seems to be an effect of so-called elective affinity is brought about&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only&nbsp;</em>by an electrical polarity which in certain substances is present in greater strength than in others. The conclusion then after all this meandering in hypothetical conceptions, is that we are left with the category of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">greater intensity,&nbsp;</em>which is the same formal determination as elective affinity in general; and since the latter is made to depend on a greater intensity of electrical polarity, it is not a whit nearer to being put on a physical basis than it was before. But even what is here supposed to be determined as a greater specific intensity is subsequently reduced to the modifications demonstrated by Berthollet which have already been cited.</p>

Chemical substances form a system of relations with respect to saturation; saturation itself rests on the specific proportion in which the reciprocal amounts of two substances, each of which has a particular material existence, combine with each other. But there are also measure relations the moments of which are inseparable and cannot be displayed in a separate and distinct existence of their own. These are what we called earlier on,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate self-subsistent</em>&nbsp;measures and which are displayed in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific gravity of</em>&nbsp;substances. They are a ratio within the substances of weight to volume; the exponent of the ratio, which is the expression of the difference between one specific gravity and another, is a definite quantum only as a result&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of.comparison.</em>This is a relationship external to the substances in an external reflection, and is not founded on the one substance&#39;s own qualitative behaviour towards another contrasted substance. The problem would be to recognize the exponents of the ratios of the series of specific gravities as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">system&nbsp;</em>based on a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">rule&nbsp;</em>which would specify a merely arithmetical plurality into a series of harmonic nodes. The same demand would apply to our knowledge of the series of chemical affinities already mentioned. But the accomplishment of this task still lies a long way ahead, as far ahead as the problem of grasping the numbers of the relative distances of the planets from the sun as elements in a system of measure.</p>

When substances are chemically combined, or even form only amalgams or synsomates, there occurs also a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">neutralisation&nbsp;</em>of the specific gravities. We mentioned earlier on the fact that the volume of a mixture, even a mixture of substances remaining really indifferent chemically to each other, is not of the same magnitude as the sum of the volumes of the substances before mixing. There is a reciprocal modification in the mixture of the quantum of specific gravity with which the substances enter into the relation and in this way they indicate their qualitative behaviour towards each other. Here the quantum of specific gravity is expressed not merely as a fixed&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comparative number,&nbsp;</em>but as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">numerical ratio&nbsp;</em>which can be varied; and the exponents of the mixtures give series of measures the specifying principle of which is other than the numerical ratios of the specific gravities of the substances in combination. The exponents of these ratios are not exclusive determinations of measure; their progress is continuous but it contains an immanent specifying law which is distinct from the formally progressive ratios in which the amounts are combined and makes the former progress incommensurable with the latter.</p>

For the relation of this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistent&nbsp;</em>unity, of the elective affinity to the other neutralities, no further principle of specification has offered itself; the specification resides only in the quantitative determination of affinity in general, according to which the amounts which neutralise themselves are specific and therefore stand opposed to other relative elective affinities of their moments. But further, because the fundamental determination is quantitative, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exclusive</em>&nbsp;elective affinity also continues itself into the opposed neutralities; and this continuity is not only an external relation of the different ratios of the neutralities in the form of a comparison, but the neutrality is, as such,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">separable into the moments&nbsp;</em>which united to produce it, since it is as self-subsistent somethings that these enter into relation indifferently with one or the other of the opposite series, although combining in different, specifically determined amounts.

These relations differ from the affinities of the kind above-mentioned in which a self-subsistent measure relates itself to self-subsistent measures of a different quality and to a series of such. They take place in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one and the same&nbsp;</em>substrate within the same moments of the neutrality; the self-repelling measure develops other, merely quantitatively different relations which likewise form affinities and measures, alternating with those which remain only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitatively&nbsp;</em>different. They form in this way a nodal line of measures on a scale of more and less.</p>

Such a being-for-self, because it is at the same time essentially a relation of quanta, is open to externality and to quantitative alteration; it has a range within which it remains indifferent to this alteration and does not change its quality. But there enters a point in this quantitative alteration at which the quality is changed and the quantum shows itself as specifying, so that the altered quantitative relation is converted into a measure, and thus into a new quality, a new something. The relation which has taken the place of the first is determined by this, partly according to the qualitative identity of the moments which are in affinity, and partly according to the quantitative continuity. But because the difference falls into this quantitative aspect, the relation between the new something and its predecessor is one of indifference; their difference is the external one of quantum. The new something has therefore not emerged from or developed out of its predecessor but directly from itself, that is, from the inner specifying unity which has not yet entered into existence. The new quality or new something is subjected to the same progressive alteration, and so on to infinity.</p>

From this side, the alteration is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">gradual</em>&nbsp;But the gradualness concerns merely the external side of the alteration, not its qualitative aspect; the preceding quantitative relation which is infinitely near the following one is still a different qualitative existence. On the qualitative side, therefore, the gradual, merely quantitative progress which is not in itself a limit, is absolutely interrupted; the new quality in its merely quantitative relationship is, relatively to the vanishing quality, an indifferent, indeterminate other, and the transition is therefore a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">leap;&nbsp;</em>both are posited as completely external to each other. People fondly try to make an alteration&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comprehensible&nbsp;</em>by means of the gradualness of the transition; but the truth is that gradualness is an alteration which is merely indifferent, the opposite of qualitative change. In gradualness too, the connection of the two realities, whether these are taken to be states or self-subsistent things, is eliminated; gradualness necessarily implies that neither of the two is the limit of the other but that each is completely external to the other. In this way there is eliminated the very factor which is necessary for an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">understanding&nbsp;</em>of change, although little enough is required for that purpose.</p>

It is on the one hand a merely quantitative progress and regress, a perpetual adding or subtracting, so that each number has the same<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">arithmetical&nbsp;</em>relation to the one before it and after it, as these have to their predecessors and successors, and so on. But the numbers so formed also have a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific&nbsp;</em>relation to other numbers preceding and following them, being either an integral multiple of one of them or else a power or a root. In the musical scale which is built up on quantitative differences, a quantum gives rise to an harmonious relation without its own relation to those on either side of it in the scale differing from the relation between these again and their predecessors and successors. While successive notes seem to be at an ever-increasing distance from the keynote, or numbers in succeeding each other arithmetically seem only to become other numbers, the fact is that there suddenly emerges a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">return,</em>&nbsp;a surprising accord, of which no hint was given by the quality of what immediately preceded it, but which appears as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actio in distans,&nbsp;</em>as a connection with something far removed. There is a sudden interruption of the succession of merely indifferent relations which do not alter the preceding specific reality or do not even form any such, and although the succession is continued quantitatively in the same manner, a specific relation breaks in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">per saltum.</em></p>

These products are distinguished from one another not merely by a more or less, and they are not already present, or only perhaps in a weaker degree, in the proportions close to the nodal proportions, but are bound up with these nodes themselves. For example, different oxides of nitrogen and nitric acids having essentially different qualities are formed only when oxygen and nitrogen are combined in certain specific proportions, and no such specific compounds are formed by the intermediate proportions. Metal oxides, e.g. the lead oxides, are formed at certain quantitative points of oxidation and are distinguished by colours and other qualities. They do not pass gradually into one another; the proportions lying in between these nodes do not produce a neutral or a specific substance. Without having passed through the intervening stages, a specific compound appears which is based on a measure relation and possesses characteristic qualities. Again, water when its temperature is altered does not merely get more or less hot but passes through from the liquid into either the solid or gaseous states; these states do not appear gradually; on the contrary, each new state appears as a leap, suddenly interrupting and checking the gradual succession of temperature changes at these points. Every birth and death, far from being a progressive gradualness, is an interruption of it and is the leap from a quantitative into a qualitative alteration.</p>

The attempt to explain coming-to-be or ceasing-to-be on the basis of gradualness of the alteration is tedious like any tautology; what comes to be or ceases to be is assumed as already complete and in existence beforehand and the alteration is turned into a mere change of an external difference, with the result that the explanation is in fact a mere tautology.

With the expansion of the state and an increased number of citizens, the laws and the constitution acquire a different significance. The state has its own measure of magnitude and when this is exceeded this mere change of size renders it liable to instability and disruption under that same constitution which was its good fortune and its strength before its expansion.</p>

Thus there is posited the alternation of specific existences with one another and of these equally with relations remaining merely quantitative &mdash; and so on&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ad infinitum.&nbsp;</em>What therefore is present in this transition is both the negation of the specific relations and the negation of the quantitative progress itself &mdash; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite&nbsp;</em>which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for itself</em>.

Hence the alteration of the qualitative itself into the qualitative is posited as an external and indifferent change, as a coming together with itself; moreover, the quantitative, in being converted into the qualitative, into that which is determined in and for itself, sublates itself. This unity which thus continues itself into itself in its alternating measures is the truly persisting, self-subsistent material substance or thing.</p>

Measure is, in the first instance, only the immediate unity of quality and quantity as an ordinary quantum which is, however, specific. As thus a specific quantity which is related not to another but to itself, it is essentially a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ratio.&nbsp;</em>It therefore also contains its moments as sublated and undivided within itself; as is always the case in a Notion, the difference in the ratio is present in such a manner that each of its moments is itself a unity of quality and quantity. The difference therefore is real and yields a number of measure relations which, as formal totalities in themselves, are selfsubsistent. The two series formed by the sides of these ratios are the same constant arrangement for each individual member which, as belonging to one side, enters into relationship with all the members of the opposite series.</p>

In this unity of the substrate with itself the measure determination is sublated and its quality is an external state determined by the quantum. This process is equally the progressive determination of measure in its realisation and also the reduction of measure to the status of a moment.</p>

For this difference, there are present the determinations of quality and quantity which the measure contains, and everything turns solely on how these are posited in it.

But the indifference is this fixed measure, the implicit, absolute limit, only in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>to those differences in such a manner that it would not be in its own self a quantum or opposed in any way, either as a sum or even as an exponent, to other quanta whether sums or indifferences. It is only the abstract determinateness which falls into the indifference; the two quanta, in order that they may be posited in it as moments, are variable, indifferent, greater or smaller relatively to one another. Bounded however by the fixed limit of their sum, they are related to each other not externally but negatively, and this now is the qualitative determination of their relationship. They are consequently&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inversely proportional.&nbsp;</em>This relation is distinguished from the earlier formal inverted relation or inverse ratio by the fact that here the whole is a real substrate and each of the two sides is posited as having to be itself in principle [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an sich</em>] this whole.</p>

The substrate itself, as an indifference, is likewise in itself the unity of both qualities; therefore each side of the relation, too, contains both sides within itself and is distinguished from the other side only by a more of the one quality and a less of the other, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vice versa.&nbsp;</em>The one quality is through its quantum only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">preponderant&nbsp;</em>in the one side, and so, too, the other quality in the other side.</p>

As formal, this relation recurs in the two distinct sides. These sides thus continue themselves into each other also in respect of their qualitative determinations; each quality is self-related in the other and is present in each of the two sides, only in a different quantum. Their quantitative difference is that indifference in accordance with which they continue themselves into each other and this continuation as the self-sameness of the qualities is in each of the two unities. The sides, however, each as the whole of the two determinations and hence containing the indifference itself, are thus at the same time posited as self-subsistent relatively to each other.</p>

Consequently, the difference between them is posited in the first place as sublated, therefore as only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative,&nbsp;</em>but not as the self-repulsion of the indifference, and the indifference is not posited as self-determining but as being determinate and determined only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externally</em>.&nbsp;<span class="pointq" style="color: rgb(0, 80, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">[b]</span>&nbsp;The two moments are in an inverted quantitative relation-a to and fro in the scale of magnitude; but this fluctuation is determined not by the indifference, which is just the indifference of this fluctuation, but is determined herewith only externally. The principle of determination resides not in the indifference, but in something lying outside it. The absolute, as indifference, has in this aspect the second defect of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative&nbsp;</em>form, namely that the determinateness of the difference is not determined by the absolute itself; just as it has the first defect in the fact that the differences simply&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">emerge&nbsp;</em>in it, that is to say, the absolute&#39;s positing is immediate in character, is not the mediation of the absolute with itself.&nbsp;<span class="pointq" style="color: rgb(0, 80, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">[c]</span>&nbsp;The quantitative determinateness of the moments which are now&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sides&nbsp;</em>of the relation constitutes this mode of their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsistence;&nbsp;</em>through this indifference their determinate being is freed from the transition of the qualitative sphere.

The difference between the two sides is restricted to this, that one quality is posited in the one side with a more and in the other with a less, and the other quality similarly, but conversely. Hence each side is in its own self the totality of the indifference. Each of the two qualities taken singly on its own account also remains the same sum which the indifference is; it continues itself out of the one side into the other and is not bounded by the quantitative limit which is thereby posited in it. In consequence of this the determinations come into immediate opposition and this develops itself into a contradiction which we have now to consider.</p>

If the two qualities are self-subsistent &mdash; taken, say, as if they were sensuous things independent of each other &mdash; then the whole determinateness of indifference falls asunder; their unity and totality would be empty names. But they are at the same time expressly determined as comprised in a single unity, as inseparable, each as having meaning and reality only in this one qualitative relation to the other. But now,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">because their quantitativity is simply and solely of this qualitative nature, each reaches only as far as the other.&nbsp;</em>If the qualities are regarded simply as distinct quanta, then the one would reach beyond the other and would have in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more&nbsp;</em>an indifferent determinate being which the other would not have.

This vanishing appears to quantitative conception as a disturbance of the equilibrium so that the one factor becomes greater than the other; thus there is posited the sublating of the quality of the other and its lack of any support. One factor becomes preponderant as the other diminishes with an accelerated velocity and is overpowered by the first, which therefore constitutes itself the sole self-subsistent quality; but this being so, there are no longer two specific moments and factors but only the one whole.</p>

This example exhibits primarily only two qualities in inverse relation to each other, not two sides, each of which is itself the unity of both and their inverse relation. The fact, the inverse relation, rests on a firm empirical foundation, but the theoretical explanation of it involves a consequence which is overlooked, namely the destruction of the basic fact; or if, as is proper, the fact is retained it escapes notice that the theory proves to be meaningless in face of the fact. The ignoring of this consequence allows the fact and the theory conflicting with it to exist calmly side by side. The simple fact is that in the elliptical motion of the celestial bodies their velocity is accelerated as they approach perihelion and retarded as they approach aphelion. The quantitative side of this fact has been accurately ascertained by the untiring diligence of observation, and further, it has been reduced to its simple law and formula.</p>

For the purpose of a so-called explanation of the phenomenon and its law a centripetal and a centrifugal force are assumed as qualitative moments of the curvilinear motion. Qualitatively, their difference consists in the opposed direction of the moments, and quantitatively, the moments being determined as unequal, in the fact that as the one increases the other is supposed to decrease, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vice versa;&nbsp;</em>then further, that their relationship is reversed again so that after a period during which the centripetal force has been increasing and the centrifugal force decreasing, a point is reached where the former decreases and the latter increases. But this way of representing the matter is contradicted by the essentially qualitative relation between their respective determinatenesses which makes their separation from each other completely out of the question. Each has meaning only with reference to the other; consequently, in so far as the one had an excess over the other, to that extent it would have no relation to it and the other would no longer exist. If it is assumed that one of them is at one time greater than the other, being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">related&nbsp;</em>to it as the greater to the smaller, then what was said above applies, namely, that the greater would acquire absolute preponderance and the other would vanish; the other would be posited as a vanishing moment without any support; and nothing would be altered by supposing the vanishing to take place only gradually any more than by supposing that by as much as the vanishing moment decreases in magnitude the other increases, for the latter, too, is destroyed with the former, since it is what it is, only in so far as the other is. It requires but little consideration to see that if, for example, as is alleged, the body&#39;s centripetal force increases as it approaches perihelion, while the centrifugal force is supposed to decrease proportionately, the latter<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">would no longer be able&nbsp;</em>to tear the body away from the former and to set it again at a distance from its central body; on the contrary, for once the former has gained the preponderance, the other is overpowered and the body is carried towards its central body with accelerated velocity. Just as conversely, if the centrifugal force gains the upper hand when infinitely near to aphelion, it is equally contradictory that now, in the aphelion itself, it should be overpowered by the weaker force.</p>

The conclusion which follows from the vanishing of one or the other direction and hence of the elliptical motion altogether, is ignored and concealed because of the undeniable fact that this motion does go on and pass from the accelerated into the retarded velocity. The assumed transformation of the weakness of the centripetal force in aphelion into a preponderant strength over the centrifugal force, and conversely in perihelion, implies first the conclusion arrived at above, namely, that each side of the inverse relation is in its own self the whole inverse relation; for the side of the motion from aphelion to perihelion (when the centripetal force is supposed to be preponderant) is still supposed to contain the centrifugal force which, however, diminishes as the other increases, while on the side of the retarded motion the centrifugal force is assumed to be present in that same inverse relation in an ever-increasing preponderance over the centripetal force. Consequently, on neither side has either force vanished but only become increasingly smaller up to the point of its transformation into a preponderance over the other. All that recurs then on either side is the defect characteristic of this inverse relation, namely, either each force is credited with an independent self-subsistence, the pair being merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externally&nbsp;</em>associated in a motion (as in the parallelogram of forces), in which case the unity of the Notion, the nature of the thing itself, is left out of account; or else, since each is qualitatively related to the other by the Notion, neither can attain an indifferent independent subsistence in face of the other, a subsistence supposedly imparted to it by a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more.&nbsp;</em>The form of intensity, the so-called dynamic factor, does not help, because this too has its determinateness in quantum and consequently can express only as much force (which is the measure of its existence) as is opposed to it by the opposite force. Secondly, this sudden change round from a preponderance into its opposite implies the alternation of the qualitative determination of positive and negative; an increase in the one means an equivalent loss in the other. In the theory, the inseparable qualitative connectedness of this qualitative opposition is distorted into a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">succession in time;</em>&nbsp;but it fails thereby to give an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">explanation&nbsp;</em>of this alternation and more particularly of this distortion itself. The semblance of unity which is still implied in the increasing of one side with an equivalent decreasing of the other vanishes here completely; what is alleged is a merely external succession of the sides which only contradicts what is necessarily implied in their qualitative connectedness, namely that with the preponderance of one side the other must disappear.</p>

If we stop short at the abstraction [of substance] then it is a matter of complete indifference what something looked like in reality before it was swallowed up in this abyss. But when substance is conceived as indifference, it is tied up with the need for determining it and for taking this determining into consideration; it is not to remain Spinoza&#39;s substance, the sole determination of which is the negative one that everything is absorbed in it. With Spinoza, the moment of difference &mdash; attributes, thought and extension, then the modes too, the affections, and every other determination &mdash; is introduced quite empirically; it is intellect, itself a mode, which is the source of the differentiation.</p>

But by the determination of substance as indifference, the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference too,</em>&nbsp;comes to be reflected on; whereas with Spinoza, the difference is an external, and more precisely a quantitative difference&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only by implication,&nbsp;</em>now it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>as such. The indifference does indeed, like substance, remain immanent in the differentiated moments, but only abstractly so, only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly;&nbsp;</em>the difference is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not</em>&nbsp;immanent in the indifference, for as quantitative it is rather the opposite of immanence, and the quantitative indifference is rather the self-externality of the unity. Thus the difference is also not grasped qualitatively; substance is not determined as selfdifferentiating, not as subject. The immediate consequence with respect to the category of indifference itself is that in it the difference of quantitative or qualitative determination falls apart as we found in the explication of indifference; it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dissolution of measure,&nbsp;</em>in which both moments were directly posited as one.</p>

The further step which requires to be made here is to grasp that this reflection of the differences into their unity is not merely the product of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>reflection of the subjective thinker, but that it is the very nature of the differences of this unity to sublate themselves, with the result that their unity proves to be absolute negativity, its indifference to be just as much indifferent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">to itself,&nbsp;</em>to its own indifference, as it is indifferent to otherness.</p>

As thus the contradiction of itself and its determinedness, of its implicit determination and its posited determinateness, it is the negative totality whose determinatenesses have sublated themselves in themselves and in so doing have sublated this fundamental one-sidedness of theirs, their [merely] implicit being [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Ansichsein</em>]. The result is that indifference is now posited as what it in fact is, namely a simple and infinite, negative relation-to-self, its inherent incompatibility with itself, a repelling of itself from itself. The process of determining and being determined is not a transition, nor an external alteration, nor an emergence of determinations in the indifference, but is its own self-relating which is the negativity of itself, of its [merely] implicit being.</p>

The sphere of determinate being is thereby made the base, and the fact that the being in this determinate being is being-in-and-for-itself, is a further determination external to determinate being itself; and conversely, while essence is indeed being-in-and-for-itself, it is so only in relation to an other, in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific&nbsp;</em>reference. Accordingly, in so far as the distinction is made of an essential and an unessential side in something [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Dasein</em>], this distinction is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externally&nbsp;</em>posited, a separation of one part of it from another that does not affect the something itself, a division which has its origin in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">third.&nbsp;</em>Such a division does not settle what is essential and what is unessential. It originates in some external standpoint and consideration and the same content can therefore be regarded now as essential and again as unessential.</p>

In this way, essence is only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first&nbsp;</em>negation, or the negation which is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness</em>through which being becomes only determinate being, or the latter becomes only an other. But essence is the absolute negativity of being; it is being itself, but not determined only as an other, but being that has sublated itself both as immediate being and also as immediate negation, as negation that is infected with otherness. Thus being, or determinate being, has not preserved itself as an other &mdash; for we are in the sphere of essence &mdash; and the immediate that is still distinguished from essence is not merely an unessential determinate being but the immediate that is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in and for itself&nbsp;</em>a nullity; it is only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-essence, illusory&nbsp;</em>being.</p>

Scepticism did not permit itself to say &#39;It is&#39;; modern idealism did not permit itself to regard knowledge as a knowing of the thing-in-itself; the illusory being of scepticism was supposed to lack any foundation of being, and in idealism the thing-in-itself was not supposed to enter into knowledge.

Illusory being is, therefore, itself&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediately</em>&nbsp;determinate. It can have this or that content; whatever content it has, illusory being does not posit this itself but has it immediately. The various forms of idealism, Leibnizian, Kantian, Fichtean, and others, have not advanced beyond being as determinateness, have not advanced beyond this immediacy, any more than scepticism did. Scepticism permits the content of its illusory being to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">given</em>&nbsp;to it; whatever content it is supposed to have, for scepticism it is<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate</em>. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">monad</em>&nbsp;of Leibnitz evolves its ideas and representations out of itself; but it is not the power that generates and binds them together, rather do they arise in the monad like bubbles; they are indifferent and immediate over against one another and the same in relation to the monad itself. Similarly,&nbsp;<a name="HL2_397"></a>the Kantian Appearance is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">given</em>&nbsp;content of perception; it presupposes affections, determinations of the subject, which are immediate relatively to themselves and to the subject. It may well be that the infinite obstacle of Fichte&#39;s idealism has no underlying thing-in-itself, so that it becomes purely a determinateness in the ego; but for the ego, this determinateness which it appropriates and whose externality it sublates is at the same time&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate</em>, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limitation</em>&nbsp;of the ego, which it can transcend but which has in it an element of indifference, so that although the limitation is on the ego, it contains an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate</em>&nbsp;non-being of the ego.</span></p>

Furthermore, this immediacy is the sublated negation and the sublated return-into-self. Reflection, as sublating the negative, is a sublating of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its other,</em>&nbsp;of immediacy. Since, therefore, it is immediacy as a returning movement, as a coincidence of the negative with itself, it is equally a negative of the negative as negative. Thus it is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposing.&nbsp;</em>Or immediacy, as a returning movement, is only the negative of itself, only this, to be not immediacy; but reflection is the sublating of the negative of itself, it is a coincidence with itself; it therefore sublates its positing, and since in its positing it sublates its positing, it is a presupposing. Reflection, in its presupposing, determines the return-into-self as the negative of itself, as that, the sublating of which is essence. The presupposing is the manner in which it relates itself to itself, but to itself as the negative of itself; only thus is it the self-relating negativity that remains internal to itself. Immediacy presents itself simply and solely as a return and is that negative which is the illusory being of the beginning, the illusory being which is negated by the return. Accordingly, the return of essence is its self-repulsion. In other words, reflection-into-self is essentially the presupposing of that from which it is the return.</p>

But external or real reflection presupposes itself as sublated, as the negative of itself In this determination it is doubled: it is what is presupposed, or reflection-into-self, which is the immediate; and also it is reflection that is negatively self-related; it is related to itself as to its non-being.</p>

Its relationship to its presupposition is such that the latter is the negative of reflection, but so that this negative as negative is sublated. Reflection in its positing, immediately sublates its positing and thus has an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate presupposition.&nbsp;</em>It therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finds&nbsp;</em>this before it as something from which it starts, and from which it is first the return-into-self, the negating of this its negative. But the fact that what is thus presupposed is a negative or is posited does not concern it; this determinateness belongs only to the positing reflection, but in the presupposing the positedness is present only as sublated. The determinations posited by the external reflection in the immediate are to that extent external to the latter. This external reflection in the sphere of being was the infinite; the finite ranked as the first, as the real; as the foundation, the abiding foundation, it forms the starting point and the infinite is the reflection-into-self over against it.</p>

But in doing so it is immediately equally a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positing,&nbsp;</em>a sublating of the immediate negatively related to it, and this immediate from which it seemed to start as from something alien,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>only in this its beginning. In this way, the immediate is not only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>&nbsp;&mdash; that means, for us, or in external reflection &mdash; identical with reflection, but this identicalness is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited.&nbsp;</em>For the immediate is determined by reflection as its negative or its other, but it is reflection itself that negates this determining. Hence the externality of reflection over against the immediate is sublated; its positing in which it negates itself, is the union of itself with its negative, with the immediate, and this union is the immediacy of essence itself. The fact is, therefore, that external reflection is not external, but is no less the immanent reflection of immediacy itself; in other words, the outcome of positing reflection is essence in and for itself. Reflection is thus&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determining reflection.</em></p>

But in external reflection there is also implicit the notion of absolute reflection; for the universal, the principle or rule and law to which it advances in its determining, counts as the essence of that immediate which forms the starting point; and this immediate therefore counts as a nullity, and it is only the return from it, its determining by reflection, that is the positing of the immediate in accordance with its true being. Therefore, what reflection does to the immediate, and the determinations which issue from reflection, are not anything external to the immediate but are its own proper being.</p>

And intellectual reflection, in so far as it operates as external reflection, does in fact start from something immediately given which is alien to it, regarding itself as a merely formal activity which receives its content and material from outside and which, by itself, is only the movement conditioned by that content and material. Further, as will become more evident as soon as we come to consider determining reflection,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the reflected determinations&nbsp;</em>are of a different kind from the merely immediate determinations of being. The latter are more readily granted to be transient, merely relative and standing in relation to other; but the reflected determinations have the form of being-in-and-for-self. This makes them count as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential,&nbsp;</em>and instead of passing over into their opposites they appear rather as absolute, free, and indifferent towards each other. Consequently, they are stubbornly opposed to their movement, their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>is their self-identity in their determinateness, in accordance with which, even though they presuppose each other, they maintain themselves completely separate in this relation.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/james-clr/works/dialecti/james3.htm#J308" style="color: rgb(51, 0, 80); background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong>&copy;</strong></a></p>

External reflection, when it determines, posits an other-but this is essence-in the place of the sublated being; but the determination thus posited is not put in the place of an other; the positing has no presupposition. But that is why it is not the completed, determining reflection; the determination that it posits is consequently only something posited; it is an immediate, but not as equal to itself but as negating itself; it has an absolute relation to the return-into-self; it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>only in reflection-into-self, but it is not this reflection itself.</p>

In the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sphere of being, determinate being&nbsp;</em>was the being in which negation was present, and being was the immediate base and element of this negation, which consequently was itself immediate. In the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sphere of essence, positedness&nbsp;</em>corresponds to determinate being. It is likewise a determinate being but its base is being as essence or as pure negativity; it is a determinateness or negation, not as affirmatively present [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">seiend</em>] but immediately as sublated.<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Determinate being is merely posited being or positedness;&nbsp;</em>this is the proposition of essence about determinate being. Positedness stands opposed, on the one hand, to determinate being, and on the other, to essence, and is to be considered as the middle term which unites determinate being with essence, and conversely, essence with determinate being. Accordingly, when it is said that a determination is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only&nbsp;</em>a positedness, this can have a twofold meaning; it is a positedness as opposed to determinate being or as opposed to essence. In the former meaning, determinate being is taken to be superior to positedness and the latter is ascribed to external reflection, to the subjective side. But in fact positedness is the superior; for as positedness, determinate being is that which it is in itself, a negative, something that is simply and solely related to the return-into-self. It is for this reason that positedness is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only&nbsp;</em>a positedness with respect to essence, as the negation of the accomplished return-into-self.</p>

The latter is immediate relation to other in general; positedness, too, is a relation to other, but to reflectedness-into-self. Negation as quality, is negation simply as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affirmative</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">seiend</em>]; being constitutes its ground and element. The determination of reflection, on the other hand, has for this ground reflectedness-into-self. Positedness fixes itself into a determination precisely because reflection is equality-with-self in its negatedness; its negatedness is consequently itself a reflection-into-self. Here the determination persists not through&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>but through its equality with itself. Because being, which supports quality, is not equal to the negation, quality is unequal within itself and hence a transitory moment vanishing in the other. The determination of reflection, on the other hand, is positedness as negation, negation which has negatedness as its ground; it is therefore not unequal within itself, and hence is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential,&nbsp;</em>not transitory determinateness. It is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the equality of reflection with itself&nbsp;</em>that possesses the negative only as negative, as sublated or posited being, that enables the negative to persist.</p>

For as positedness, it is negation as such, a non-being over against an other, namely,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">over against&nbsp;</em>absolute reflection-into-self, or over against essence. But as self-relation it is reflected into itself. This its reflection and the above positedness are distinct; its positedness is rather its sublatedness; but its reflectedness-into-self is its subsistence. In so far, therefore, as it is the positedness that is at the same time reflection-into-self, the determinateness of reflection is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the relation to its otherness within itself.</em>It is not an affirmative [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">seiende</em>], quiescent determinateness, which would be related to an other in such a way that the related term and its relation are distinct from each other, the former a being-within-self, a something that excludes its other and its relation to this other from itself; on the contrary, the determination of reflection is in its own self&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the determinate side&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of this determinate side as determinate, that is, to its negation. Quality, through its relation, passes over into an other; in its relation its alteration begins. The determination of reflection, on the other hand, has taken its otherness back into itself. It is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positedness,&nbsp;</em>negation, which however bends back into itself the relation to other, and negation which is equal to itself, the unity of itself and its other, and only through this is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essentiality.&nbsp;</em>It is, therefore, positedness, negation; but as reflection-into-self it is at the same time the sublatedness of this positedness, infinite self-relation.</p>

We should then have the propositions, for example: everything is, everything has a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate being,&nbsp;</em>and so on, or: everything has a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quality, quantity,</em>&nbsp;etc. For being, determinate being, and so forth, are, simply as logical categories, predicates of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">everything.&nbsp;</em>According to its etymology and Aristotle&#39;s definition, category is what is predicated or asserted of the existent. But a determinateness of being is essentially a transition into its opposite; the negative of any determinateness is as necessary as the latter itself; as immediate determinatenesses, each is directly confronted by the other. Consequently, if these categories are put in the form of such propositions, then the opposite propositions equally appear; both present themselves with equal necessity and, as immediate assertions, are at least equally correct. The one, therefore, would demand proof as against the other, and consequently these assertions could no longer be credited with the character of immediately true and incontestable propositions of thought.</p>

They are self-related, and so are at the same time determinations removed from determinateness against an other. Further, in that they are determinatenesses which are in themselves<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relations,&nbsp;</em>to that extent they already contain within themselves the prepositional form. For the difference between proposition and judgement is mainly that in the former the content constitutes the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>itself or is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific relation.&nbsp;</em>The judgement, on the contrary, transfers the content to the predicate as a universal determinateness which is for itself and is distinct from its relation, the simple copula. When a proposition is to be converted into a judgement, then the specific content &mdash; if, for example it is a verb &mdash; is changed into a participle, in order to separate in this way the determination itself and its relation to a subject. For the determinations of reflection, on the contrary, as positedness reflected into itself, the prepositional form itself lies immediately at hand. Only, since they are enunciated as universal&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">laws of thought,&nbsp;</em>they still require a subject of their relation, and this subject is:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">everything,&nbsp;</em>or an A, which equally means each and every existent.</p>

Further, these propositions are defective in that they have for subject,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being, everything.&nbsp;</em>In this way, they resuscitate being and enunciate the categories of reflection-identity, and so on-of the something as a quality which something has in it, not in the speculative sense, but meaning that something as subject persists in such a quality as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simply affirmative&nbsp;</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">als seiendes</em>], not that it has passed over into identity, and so on, as into its truth and its essence.</p>

In its opinion, reason is nothing more than a loom on which it externally combines and interweaves the warp, of say, identity, and then the woof of difference; or, also, again proceeding analytically, it now extracts especially identity and<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">then also again&nbsp;</em>obtains difference alongside it, is now a positing of likeness and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">then also again&nbsp;</em>a positing of unlikeness &mdash; likeness when&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstraction&nbsp;</em>is made from difference, and unlikeness when abstraction is made from the positing of likeness. These assertions and opinions about what reason does must be completely set aside, since they are in a certain measure merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">historical;&nbsp;</em>the truth is rather that a consideration of everything that is, shows that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own self&nbsp;</em>everything is in its self-sameness different from itself and self-contradictory, and that in its difference, in its contradiction, it is self-identical, and is in its own self&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">this movement of transition of one of these categories into the other</span>, and for this reason, that each is in its own self the opposite of itself. The Notion of identity, that it is simple self-related negativity, is not a product of external reflection but has come from being itself. Whereas, on the contrary, that identity that is aloof from difference, and difference that is aloof from identity, are products of external reflection and abstraction, which arbitrarily clings to this point of indifferent difference.</p>

As absolute negation it is the negation that immediately negates itself, a non-being and difference that vanishes in its arising, or a distinguishing by which nothing is distinguished, but which immediately collapses within itself. The distinguishing is the positing of non-being as non-being of the other. But the non-being of the other is sublation of the other and therewith of the distinguishing itself. Here, then, distinguishing is present as self-related negativity, as a non-being which is the non-being of itself, a non-being which has its non-being not in another but in its own self. What is present, therefore, is self-related, reflected difference, or pure,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute difference.</em></p>

Thus it is identity as difference that is identical with itself. But difference is only identical with itself in so far as it is not identity but absolute non-identity.

For it is not pretended that the experiment with the abstract proposition&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">A = A&nbsp;</em>has been made on every consciousness. The appeal, then, to actually carried-out experiment is not to be taken seriously; it is only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">assurance&nbsp;</em>that if the experiment were made, the proposition would be universally admitted. But if what were meant were not the abstract proposition as such, but its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete application&nbsp;</em>from which the former were supposed first to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">developed,&nbsp;</em>then the assertion of its universality and immediacy would consist in the fact that every consciousness would&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">treat it as fundamental,&nbsp;</em>even in every utterance it made, or that it lies&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>in every utterance.

Expressed as a proposition, the concrete would at first be a synthetic proposition. From the concrete itself or its synthetic proposition, abstraction could indeed extract by analysis the proposition of identity; but then, in fact, it would not have left&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">experience&nbsp;</em>as it is, but<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">altered&nbsp;</em>it; for the fact is that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">experience&nbsp;</em>contains identity in unity with difference and is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate refutation&nbsp;</em>of the assertion that abstract identity as such is something true, for the exact opposite, namely, identity only in union with difference, occurs in every experience.</p>

If, for example, to the question &quot;What is a plant?&quot; the answer is given &quot;A plant is a plant&quot;, the truth of such a statement is at once admitted by the entire company on whom it is tested, and at the same time it is equally unanimously declared that the statement says&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing.&nbsp;</em>If anyone opens his mouth and promises to state what God is, namely God is &mdash; God, expectation is cheated, for what was expected was a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">different determination;&nbsp;</em>and if this statement is absolute truth, such absolute verbiage is very lightly esteemed; nothing will be held to be more boring and tedious than conversation which merely reiterates the same thing, or than such talk which yet is supposed to be truth.</p>

The prepositional form can be regarded as the hidden necessity of adding to abstract identity the more of that movement. And so an A, or a plant, or some other kind of substrate, too, is added which, as a useless content, is of no significance; but it constitutes the difference which seems to be accidentally associated with it. If instead of A or any other substrate, identity itself is taken &mdash; identity is identity &mdash; then equally it is admitted that also in its place any other substrate could be taken. Consequently, if the appeal is to be made to what experience shows, then it shows that this identity is nothing, that it is negativity, the absolute difference from itself.</p>

Here, in the sphere of reflection, difference appears as reflected difference, which is thus posited as it is in itself.</p>

The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicit&nbsp;</em>reflection is self-relation without the negation, abstract self-identity, and so simply positedness itself. The merely diverse, therefore, passes over through positedness into negative reflection. The diverse is the merely posited difference, therefore the difference that is no difference, and therefore in its own self the negati on of itself. Thus likeness and unlikeness themselves, that is, positedness, returns through indifference or the implicit reflection back into the negative unity with itself, into the reflection which the difference of likeness and unlikeness in its own self is.

Two things are not merely two &mdash; numerical manyness is only one-and-the-sameness &mdash; but they are different&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">through a determination</em>.&nbsp;<a name="HL2_422a"></a>Ordinary thinking is struck by the proposition that&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">no two things are like each other</span>&nbsp;&mdash; as in the story of how Leibniz propounded it at court and caused the ladies to look at the leaves of trees to see whether they could find two alike. Happy times for metaphysics when it was the occupation of courtiers and the testing of its propositions called for no more exertion than to compare leaves! The reason why this proposition is striking lies in what has been said, that two, or numerical manyness, does not contain any&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate</em>&nbsp;difference and that diversity as such, in its abstraction, is at first indifferent to likeness and unlikeness. Ordinary thinking, even when it goes on to a determination of diversity, takes these moments themselves to be mutually indifferent, so that one without the other, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mere likeness&nbsp;</em>of things&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">without unlikeness,</em>&nbsp;suffices to determine whether the things are different even when they are only a numerical many, not unlike, but simply different without further qualification. The law of diversity, on the other hand, asserts that things are different from one another through unlikeness, that the determination of unlikeness belongs to them just as much as that of likeness, for determinate difference is constituted only by both together.</p>

This proof would have to exhibit the passage of identity into difference, and then the passage of this into determinate difference, into unlikeness. But as a rule this is not done. We have found that diversity or external difference is, in truth, reflected into itself, is difference in its own self, that the indifferent subsistence of the diverse is a mere positedness and therefore not an external, indifferent difference, but a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">single</em>&nbsp;relation of the two moments.</p>

Positedness is likeness and unlikeness; these two reflected into themselves constitute the determinations of opposition. Their reflection-into-self consists in this, that each is in its own self the unity of likeness and unlikeness. Likeness is only in the reflection that compares on the basis of unlikeness, and therefore is mediated by its other, indifferent moment; similarly, unlikeness is only in the same reflective relationship in which likeness is. Therefore each of these moments is, in its determinateness, the whole. It is the whole in so far as it also contains its other moment; but this its other is an indifferent,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple affirmative&nbsp;</em>moment; thus each contains reference to its non-being, and is only reflection-into-self or the whole, as essentially connected with its non-being.</p>

The two sides are thus merely different, and in so far as their being determined as positive and negative constitutes their positedness in relation to one another, each is not in its own self so determined but is only determinateness in general. Therefore, although one of the determinatenesses of positive and negative belongs to each side, they can be changed round, and each side is of such a kind that it can be taken equally well as positive as negative.</p>

Each is in its own self positive and negative; the positive and negative are the determination of reflection in and for itself; it is only in this reflection of opposites into themselves that they are positive and negative.

As positive, something is, of course, determined with reference to an otherness, but in such a manner that its nature is to be not something posited; it is the reflection-into-self that negates the otherness. But the other of itself, the negative, is itself no longer a positedness or moment, but a self-subsistent being; thus the negating reflection of the positive is immanently determined as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">excluding</em>&nbsp;from itself this its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-being.</em></p>

We have just found the two real determinations of the positive and negative &mdash; apart from the simple notion of their opposition &mdash; namely, first, that the base is a merely different, immediate existence whose simple reflection-into-self is distinguished from its positedness, from the opposition itself. This opposition, therefore, is not regarded as having any truth in and for itself, and though it does belong to the different sides, so that each is simply an opposite, yet, on the other hand, each side exists indifferently on its own, and it does not matter which of the two opposites is regarded as positive or negative. But secondly, the positive is the positive in and for itself, the negative in and for itself the negative, so that the different sides are not mutually indifferent but this their determination is true in and for itself. These two forms of the positive and negative occur in the very first applications of them in arithmetic.</p>

The opposites are cancelled in their combination. An hour&#39;s journey to the east and the same distance travelled back to the west, cancels the first journey; an amount of liabilities reduces the assets by a similar amount, and an amount of assets reduces the liabilities by the same amount. At the same time, the hour&#39;s journey to the east is not in itself the positive direction, nor is the journey west the negative direction; on the contrary, these directions are indifferent to this determinateness of the opposition; it is a third point of view outside them that makes one positive and the other negative. Thus the liabilities, too, are not in and for themselves the negative; they are the negative only in relation to the debtor; for the creditor, they are his positive asset; they are an amount of money or something of a certain value, and this is a liability or an asset according to an external point of view.</p>

Just as we have pointed out that the sum of money is only one sum, that the a in +a and -a is only one a, and that the distance covered is only one distance, not two, one going east and the other going west.

Similarly, in economics, a quantum of money or of wealth is not only this one quantum as a means of subsistence but is double: it is a means of subsistence both for the creditor and for the debtor. The wealth of the state is computed not merely as the total of ready money plus the value of property movable and immovable, present in the state; still less is it reckoned as the sum remaining after deduction of liabilities from assets. For capital, even if its respective determinations of assets and liabilities nullified each other, remains first, positive capital, as +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a - a</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>; and secondly, since it is a liability in a great number of ways, being lent and re-lent, this makes it a very much multiplied capital.</p>

For example,<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>, when it bears no sign, is meant to be taken as positive if it has to be defined. If it were intended to become merely an opposite as such, it could equally well be taken as -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a&nbsp;</em>. But the positive sign is given to it immediately, because the positive on its own has the peculiar meaning of the immediate, as self-identical, in contrast to opposition.</p>

Since one factor is amount and the other unity, and the one which comes first usually means that it takes precedence, the difference between the two expressions -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;and +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;is that in the former +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;is the unit and -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;the amount, and in the latter the reverse is the case. Now in the first case it is usually said that if I am to take +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;-<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times, then I take +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;not merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times but also in the opposite manner, +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>; therefore since it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plus,&nbsp;</em>I have to take it negatively, and the product is -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>. But if, in the second case, -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;is to be taken +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times, then -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;likewise is not to be taken -<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times but in the opposite determination, namely +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em>&nbsp;times. Therefore it follows from the reasoning in the first case, that the product must be +<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a</em><sup style="font-family: Arial, monospace; font-size: x-small;">2</sup>. And similarly in the case of division.</p>

Consequently, the negative here is the intrinsically opposite as such, but the positive is an indeterminate, indifferent sign in general; it is, of course, also the negative, but the negative of the other, not in its own self the negative.

But in point of fact, this negation is not merely the first, immediate relation-to-other again, not positedness as a sublated immediacy, but as a sublated positedness. The excluding reflection of self-subsistence, being exclusive, converts itself into a positedness, but is just as much a sublating of its positedness. It is a sublating self-relation; in this, it first sublates the negative, and secondly, posits itself as a negative, and it is only this negative that it sublates; in sublating the negative, it posits and sublates itself at the same time. In this way, the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exclusive determination itself&nbsp;</em>is that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>of itself whose negation it is; consequently, the sublating of this positedness is not again a positedness as the negative of an other, but is a uniting with itself, the positive unity with itself. Self-subsistence is thus through&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its&nbsp;</em>own negation a unity returned into itself, since it returns into itself through the negation of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its own&nbsp;</em>positedness.

Opposition and its contradiction is, therefore, in ground as much abolished as preserved. Ground is essence as positive identity-with-self, which, however, at the same time relates itself to itself as negativity, and therefore determines itself and converts itself into an excluded positedness; but this positedness is the whole self-subsistent essence, and essence is ground, as self-identical and positive in this its negation. The self-contradictory, self-subsistent opposition was therefore already itself ground; all that was added to it was the determination of unity-with-self, which results from the fact that each of the self-subsistent opposites sublates itself and makes itself into its opposite, thus falling to the ground [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">zugrunde geht</em>]; but in this process it at the same time only unites with itself; therefore, it is only in falling to the ground [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in seinem Untergange</em>], that is, in its positedness or negation, that the opposite is really the essence that is reflected into and identical with itself.</p>

Indeed, if the negative expresses nothing else but the abstraction of a subjective caprice or a determination of an external comparison, than of course it does not exist for the objective positive, that is, this is not related in its own self to such empty abstraction;</span>&nbsp;that case the determination that it is a positive is likewise merely external to it. Thus, to take an example of the fixed opposition of these reflective determinations, light as such is reckoned as the pure positive and darkness as the pure negative. But light essentially possesses in its infinite expansion and in its power to promote growth and to animate, the nature of absolute negativity. Darkness, on the other hand, as a non-manifold or as the non-self-differentiating womb of generation, is the simply self-identical, the positive. It is taken as the pure negative in the sense that, as the mere absence of light, it simply does not exist for it, so that light, in its relation with darkness, is supposed to be in relation, not with an other but purely with itself, darkness therefore simply vanishing before it. But it is a familiar fact that light is dimmed to grey by darkness; and besides this merely quantitative alteration it suffers also the qualitative change of being determined to colour by its relation to darkness. Thus, for example virtue too is not without conflict; rather is it the supreme, finished conflict; as such it is not merely the positive, but is absolute negativity; also it is virtue not only in comparison with vice, but is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own self&nbsp;</em>opposition and conflict. Or again,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vice&nbsp;</em>is not merely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">lack&nbsp;</em>of virtue-innocence, too, is this lack-nor is it distinct from virtue only for an external reflection; on the contrary, it is in its own self opposed to it, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">evil.&nbsp;</em>Evil consists in being self-poised in opposition to the good; it is a positive negativity. But innocence, being neither good nor evil, is indifferent to both determinations, is neither positive nor negative. But at the same time this lack must also be taken as a determinateness: on the one hand, it is to be considered as the positive nature of something; on the other, it is related to an opposite, and every nature emerging from its innocency, from its indifferent self-identity, spontaneously relates itself to its other and thereby falls to the ground or, in the positive sense, withdraws into its ground.</p>

For as against contradiction, identity is merely the determination of the simple immediate, of dead being; but contradiction is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">root of all movement and vitality</em>; it is only in so far as something has a contradiction within it that it moves, has an urge and activity.</span></p>

We made the same remark above in connection with the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite</em>, which is the contradiction as displayed in the sphere of being. But common experience itself enunciates it when it says that at least&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">there is</em>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">host</em>&nbsp;of contradictory things, contradictory arrangements, whose contradiction exists not merely in an external reflection but in themselves. Further, it is not to be taken merely as an abnormality which occurs only here and there, but is rather the negative as determined in the sphere of essence, the principle of all self-movement, which consists solely in an exhibition of it. External, sensuous movement itself is contradiction&#39;s immediate existence. Something moves, not because at one moment it is here and at another there, but because at one and the same moment it is here and not here, because in this &#39;here&#39;, it at once is and is not. The ancient dialecticians must be granted the contradictions that they pointed out in motion; but it does not follow that therefore there is no motion, but on the contrary, that motion is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existent</em>&nbsp;contradiction itself.</span></p>

Essence, in determining itself as ground, is determined as the non-determined; its determining is only the sublating of its being determined.

But this determining is, on the one hand, as a sublating of the determining, only the restored, purified or manifested identity of essence which the reflected determination is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself;&nbsp;</em>on the other hand it is this negating movement as a determining that first posits that reflected determinateness which appeared as immediate, but which is posited only by the self-excluding reflection of ground and therein is posited as only a posited or sublated determination. Thus essence, in determining itself as ground, proceeds only from itself. As&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground,</em>therefore, it posits itself&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as essence,&nbsp;</em>and it is in positing itself as essence that its determining consists. This positing is the reflection of essence, a reflection which in its determining&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sublates&nbsp;</em>itself, on that side is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positing,&nbsp;</em>on this side is the positing&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of essence,&nbsp;</em>hence both in a single act.</p>

To add that the ground must be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sufficient</em>&nbsp;is really quite superfluous for it is self-evident; that for which the ground is not sufficient would not have a ground, but everything is supposed to have a ground. Leibnitz, however, who had the principle of the sufficient ground very much at heart and even made it the basis of his entire philosophy, associated with it a profounder meaning and more important concept than is usually connected with it when no advance is made beyond the immediate expression; although even with this meaning, the law must be considered important, for it declares being as such in its immediacy to be untrue and essentially something posited, and ground is declared to be the true immediate. But&nbsp;<a name="HL2_446b"></a>Leibnitz opposed the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sufficiency</em>&nbsp;of ground mainly to causality in its strict sense as mechanical mode of action. Since this is an altogether external activity, restricted as regards content to a single determinateness, the determinations are comprehended by their causes, but their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">connection</em>, which constitutes the essential feature of an existent, is not contained in causes belonging to the sphere of mechanism. This relationship in which the&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">whole is an essential unity</span>, lies only in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion</em>, in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">end</em>. Mechanical causes are not sufficient for this unity because their basis is not end as the unity of the determinations. Accordingly, by sufficient ground, Leibnitz understood one that was also sufficient for this unity and which therefore comprehended not merely causes, but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">final causes</em>.</p>

External reflection usually does not go beyond this distinction of essence and form; the distinction is necessary, but this distinguishing is itself their unity, just as this basic unity is essence which repels itself from itself and makes itself into a positedness. Form is absolute negativity or negative absolute self-identity through which precisely essence is not being but essence. This identity, taken abstractly, is essence as against form; just as negativity, taken abstractly, as positedness, is the single determination of form. But the determination, as we have seen, is, in its truth, the total, self-related negativity which, therefore, as this identity is in its own self simple essence.

But the two are not on that account simply present as externally and contingently opposite to one another; neither matter nor form is self-originated, or, in another terminology, eternal Matter is that which is indifferent to form, but this indifference is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>of self-identity into which form withdraws as into its basis. Form<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposes&nbsp;</em>matter in the very fact that it posits itself as sublated and consequently relates itself to this its identity as to an other. Conversely, form is presupposed by matter; for the latter is not simple essence, which is immediately itself absolute reflection, but it is essence determined as the positive, that is, essence that only is as sublated negation. But from the other side, because form posits itself as matter only in so far as it sublates, hence&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposes,&nbsp;</em>matter, matter is also determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a groundless&nbsp;</em>subsistence. Equally matter is not determined as the ground of form; but since matter posits itself as the abstract identity of the sublated form determination, it is not identity as ground, and, in so far, form is groundless relatively to it. Form and matter alike are accordingly determined as being not posited by one another, as not being the ground of one another. Matter is rather the identity of the ground and the grounded, as a basis which stands over against this form relation. This their common determination of indifference is the determination of matter as such and constitutes, too, the mutual connection of both. Similarly, the determination of form to be the relation of the two as distinct sides, is also the other moment of their mutual relationship. Matter, the indifferently determinate, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">passive&nbsp;</em>side over against form as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">active</em>side. The latter, as the self-related negative is the internal contradiction: it is self-resolving, self-repelling and self-determining. It relates itself to matter and is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>as relating itself to this its subsistence as to an other. Matter, on the other hand, is posited as being related only to itself and as indifferent to other; but it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>related to form; for it contains sublated negativity and is matter only through this determination. It is related to form as to an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>only because form is not posited in it, because it is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>form. Matter contains form locked up within it and is absolute susceptibility to form only because it has form absolutely within itself, only because form is its implicit determination.&nbsp;<a name="HL2_452"></a><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);"><em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Matter must therefore be formed</em>, and form must therefore materialise itself</span>, must give itself in matter self-identity or subsistence.</p>

This relation of the determining Is thus the mediation of each with itself through its own non-being; but these two mediations are one movement and the restoration of their original identity-the inwardising of their outwardness.

Since it is itself two-sided, this sublating, too, has a double aspect: first, it sublates&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its self-subsistence,</em>&nbsp;converts itself into something posited, into something that is in an other, and this its other is matter. Secondly, it sublates its determinateness relatively to matter, its relation to it, and consequently&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its positedness,&nbsp;</em>and in doing so gives itself a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsistence.&nbsp;</em>Since form sublates its positedness, this its reflection is its own identity into which it passes; but since, at the same time, it divests itself of this identity and opposes itself to itself as matter, this reflection of the positedness into itself is a union with a matter in which it obtains a subsistence; in this union, therefore, it is just as much united with matter&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as an other</em>&nbsp;&mdash; in accordance with the first aspect whereby it converts itself into something posited-as also, in that other, it is united&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with its own identity.</em></p>

But, conversely, in doing so, form also bears itself negatively towards matter; yet this activity by which matter is determined is just as much a movement belonging to form itself. Form is free from matter, but it sublates this its self-subsistence; but its self-subsistence is matter itself, for in this it has its essential identity. Therefore the conversion of itself into something posited is the same thing as its making matter into something determinate. But looked at from the other side, form is at the same time divested of its own identity, and matter is its other; and to this extent, matter is also not determined, since form sublates its own self-subsistence. But matter is self-subsistent only as against form; the negative, in sublating itself, also sublates the positive. Form, therefore, having sublated itself, the determinateness which matter has as against form also disappears, namely, to be an indeterminate subsistence.</p>

Through this, matter is not related to form simply as to an other: on the contrary, this external other is the form that lies concealed within matter itself. Matter is the same internal contradiction that form contains, and this contradiction, like its resolution, is only one. But matter is internally contradictory because, as indeterminate self-identity, it is also absolute negativity; it therefore sublates itself internally and its identity disintegrates in its negativity and the latter obtains from the former its subsistence. Therefore matter, in being determined by form as by something external, thereby achieves its determination, and the externality of the relationship both for form and matter consists in the fact that each, or rather their original unity, in its positing is at the same time&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposing,</em>&nbsp;with the result that the relation to itself is at the same time a relation to itself as sublated, or a relation to its other.</p>

But this finite matter as well as the finite form has no truth; each relates itself to the other, in other words, only their unity is their truth. Into this unity both these determinations withdraw and therein sublate their self-subsistence: this unity thus demonstrates itself to be their ground. Matter is therefore ground of its form-determination only in so far as it is not matter as matter, but the absolute unity of essence and form; similarly, form is ground of the subsistence of its determinations only in so far as it is the same one unity. But this one unity as absolute negativity, and more specifically, as exclusive unity is, in its reflection, presupposing; or, there is but a single activity: form in its positing both preserves itself, as posited, in the unity, and also repels itself from itself; it is related to itself as itself and also to itself as an other. Or, the process by which matter is determined by form is the mediation of essence as ground with itself in a unity, through its own self and through the negation of itself.</p>

On the one hand, what has been posited sublates itself and withdraws into its ground; but the ground, the essential self-subsistence, relates itself negatively to itself and makes itself into a positedness. This negative mediation of the ground and the grounded is the characteristic mediation of the form as such,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">formal mediation.&nbsp;</em>Now both sides of the form, because each passes over into the other, mutually posit themselves as sublated in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one identity; in</em>&nbsp;doing so they at the same time&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presuppose&nbsp;</em>this identity. It is the determinate content to which, therefore, the formal mediation is related through itself as to the positive mediating principle.

The grounded considered on its own is the sublating of itself; through this it makes itself on the one hand into a posited, and is at the same time a positing of the ground. The same movement is the ground as such, it makes itself into a posited and thereby becomes the ground of something, that is, in this movement it is present both as a posited and also first as ground. The posited is the ground that there is a ground, and conversely the ground is therefore a posited. The mediation begins just as much from the one as from the other, each side is just as much ground as posited, and each is the whole mediation or the whole form. Furthermore the whole form itself is, as the self-identical, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substrate&nbsp;</em>of the determinations which are the two sides of the ground and the grounded, and thus form and content are themselves one and the same identity.</p>

Such an assigning of grounds is therefore accompanied by the same emptiness as the talk which restricts itself to the law of identity.&nbsp;<a name="HL2_458"></a>The sciences, especially the physical sciences, are full of tautologies of this kind which constitute as it were a prerogative of science. For example, the ground of the movement of the planets round the sun is said to be the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">attractive&nbsp;</em>force of the earth and sun on one another. As regards content, this expresses nothing other than what is contained in the phenomenon, namely the relation of these bodies to one another, only in the form of a determination reflected into itself, the form of force. If one asks what kind of a force the attractive force is, the answer is that it is the force that makes the earth move round the sun; that is, it has precisely the same content as the phenomenon of which it is supposed to be the ground;&nbsp;the relation of the earth and sun in respect of motion is the identical substrate of the ground and the grounded. When a crystalline form is explained by saying that it has its ground in the particular arrangement which the molecules form with one another, the fact is that the existent crystalline form is this very arrangement that is adduced as ground. In ordinary life, these aetiologies, which are the prerogative of the sciences, count for what they are, tautological empty talk.</p>

Leibniz objected to the Newtonian force of attraction that it was the same kind of occult quality that the scholastics used for the purpose of explanation. Rather is it the opposite objection which must be made to it, namely, that it is a too familiar quality; for it has no other content than the phenomenon itself. What commends this mode of explanation is precisely its great clarity and intelligibility; for there is nothing clearer or more intelligible than that, for example, a plant has its ground in a vegetative, that is, plant-producing force. It could be called an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">occult&nbsp;</em>quality only in the sense that the ground is supposed to have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another content&nbsp;</em>than the thing to be explained, and such a ground is not adduced; the force used for the purpose of explanation is of course a concealed or occult ground in so far as the kind of ground demanded is not adduced. Something is no more explained by this formalism than the nature of a plant is known when I say that it is a plant; or that it has its ground in a plant-producing force; this statement with all its clarity can therefore be called a very<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">occult&nbsp;</em>mode of explanation.</p>

The ground is, on the one hand, ground as the reflection-into-self of the determination of the content of the phenomenon which it grounds, on the other hand, it is the posited. It is that from which the phenomenon is to be understood; but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">conversely,&nbsp;</em>it is the ground that is inferred from the phenomenon and the former is understood from the latter. The main business of this reflection consists, namely, in finding the grounds from the phenomenon, that is, converting the immediate phenomenon into the form of reflected being; consequently the ground, instead of being in and for itself and self-subsistent, is, on the contrary, the posited and derived. Now since in this procedure the ground is derived from the phenomenon and its determinations are based on it, the phenomenon certainly flows quite smoothly and with a favourable wind from its ground. But in this way, knowledge has not advanced a step; its movement is confined within a difference of form which this same procedure inverts and sublates.</p>

The exposition begins with grounds which are placed in mid-air as principles and primary concepts; they are simple determinations devoid of any necessity in and for themselves; what follows is supposed to be based on them. Therefore he who aims to penetrate such sciences must begin by instilling his mind with these grounds, a distasteful business for reason because it is asked to treat what is groundless as a valid foundation. Success comes most easily when, without much reflection, the principles are simply accepted as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">given&nbsp;</em>and one then proceeds to use them as fundamental rules of one&#39;s understanding. Without this method one cannot make a start; nor without it can any progress be made. But progress is hindered by the fact that it reveals how the method counteracts itself: it proposes to demonstrate in the consequent what is derived, but in fact it is only in the derived that the grounds of the above presuppositions are contained. Also because the consequent shows itself to be the phenomenon from which the ground was derived, this relation in which the phenomenon is presented awakens a distrust of the exposition of it; for the relation presents itself not as expressed in its immediacy but as a support for the ground. But because this again is derived from the phenomenon one demands rather to see it in its immediacy in order to be able to derive the ground from it. In such an exposition, therefore, one does not know how to take either ground or phenomenon. Uncertainty is increased, especially if the exposition is not rigorously consistent but is more&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">honest,&nbsp;</em>by the fact that one comes across traces and features of the phenomenon which point to more and different things than are contained in the principles alone. Lastly, confusion becomes still greater when reflected and merely hypothetical determinations are mingled with immediate determinations of the phenomenon itself, and the former are spoken of as though they belonged to immediate experience. Many who come to these sciences with an honest belief may well imagine that molecules, empty interstices, centrifugal force, the ether, the single, separate ray of light, electrical and magnetic matter, and a host of other such things which are spoken of as though they had an immediate existence, are things or relations actually present&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in perception.&nbsp;</em>They serve as primary grounds for something else, are enunciated as actualities and confidently applied; one lets them count as such in good faith before coming aware that they are, on the contrary, determinations inferred from that of which they are supposed to be the grounds, hypotheses and fictions derived from an uncritical reflection. In fact, one finds oneself in a kind of witches&#39; circle in which determinations of real being and determinations of reflection, ground and grounded, phenomena and phantoms, run riot in indiscriminate company and enjoy equal rank with one another.</p>

But in point of fact the two are not external to one another; for the content is this, to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the identity&nbsp;</em>of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground&nbsp;</em>with itself in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">grounded,&nbsp;</em>and of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">grounded</em>in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground.&nbsp;</em>The side of the ground has shown that it is itself a posited, and the side of the grounded that it is itself ground; each is in itself this identity of the whole. But because they belong at the same time to the form and constitute the form&#39;s determinate difference each is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its determinateness,&nbsp;</em>the identity of the whole with itself. Consequently each has a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">distinctive content&nbsp;</em>of its own. Or, considered from the side of the content, because this is the identity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of the ground-relation&nbsp;</em>with itself, it essentially possesses this difference of the form within itself, and then is, as ground, other than what it is as grounded.</p>

Therefore when we ask for a ground, we really demand that the content of the ground be a different determination from that of the phenomenon whose ground we are seeking.</p>

Namely, in so far as the two sides have a different content, they are indifferent to one another; each is an immediate, self-identical determination. Further, in their relationship as ground and grounded, the ground, in being reflected into the other as into its positedness, is reflected into itself; the content, therefore, possessed by the side of the ground, is equally in the grounded; the latter, as the posited, has its self-identity and subsistence only in the ground. But apart from this content of the ground, the grounded now also has its own distinctive content and is accordingly the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">twofold</em>&nbsp;content. Now this, as the unity of distinct sides, is indeed their negative unity, but because the determinations of the content are mutually indifferent, the unity is only their empty, intrinsically contentless relation, not their mediation; a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one&nbsp;</em>or a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something&nbsp;</em>as an external combination of them.</p>

Therefore, what more is added in the grounded to this simple&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essence,&nbsp;</em>is only an unessential form, external determinations of the content which, as such, are free from the ground and are an immediate manifoldness. Of this unessential side, therefore, the essential is not the ground, nor is it ground of the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of both to one another in the grounded. It is a positively identical that indwells the grounded, but does not posit itself therein in any difference of form, but, as self-related content, is an indifferent positive&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substrate.&nbsp;</em>Secondly, what is combined with this substrate in the something is an indifferent content, but as the unessential side. The main thing is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of the substrate and the unessential manifoldness. But because the related determinations are an indifferent content, this relation is also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not ground;&nbsp;</em>true, one of them is determined as essential and the other as unessential or posited content, but as self-related content this form is external to both. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one of the something&nbsp;</em>that constitutes their relation is therefore not a form relation but only an external bond which does not contain the unessential manifold content as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited;&nbsp;</em>it is therefore likewise only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substrate.</em></p>

Real ground contains a diversified content; but this brings with it the contingency and externality of the ground relation. On the one hand, that which is considered as the essential and therefore as the fundamental determination, is not the ground of the other determinations connected with it. On the other hand, it is also undetermined which of the several determinations of the content of a concrete thing ought to be taken as essential and as ground; hence the choice between them is free. Thus in the former respect, for example, the ground of a house is its foundation; this is the ground by virtue of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">gravity&nbsp;</em>which is inherent in sensuous matter and which is the purely identical principle in both ground and the house which is grounded. Now that there is in heavy matter such a distinction as that of a foundation and a modification distinct from it through which it constitutes a house, this fact is a matter of complete indifference to the heavy matter itself; its relation to other determinations of the content, of the end, of the furnishing of the house, and so on, is external to it; consequently, though it is indeed the foundation, it is not the ground of these determinations. Gravity, which is the ground for a house standing, is no less also the ground for a stone falling; the stone has this ground, gravity, within it; but that the stone has a further determination of its content by virtue of which it is not merely something heavy but a stone, this is external to gravity; further, it is something else that has caused the stone to be placed beforehand at a distance from the body upon which it falls; similarly time, space, and their relation, which is motion, are another content than gravity and can be conceived of without it (as the saying is), and consequently are not essentially posited by it. Gravity is also equally the ground which makes a projectile describe a trajectory opposite to that of a falling body. From the variety of determinations of which it is the ground, it is clear that something else is also required to make it the ground of this or some other determination.&nbsp;</p>

It is the same relationship as when God is characterised as the ground of nature. As ground, he is its essence; nature contains this essence and is identical with it; but nature has yet a further manifoldness which is distinct from the ground itself and is the third in which these two distinct sides are conjoined; that ground is neither ground of the manifoldness distinguished from it nor of its connection with it. The cognition of nature is therefore not from God as ground, for as ground he would only be nature&#39;s universal essence, and nature as a determinate essence is not contained in the ground.</p>

In the latter, the self-identical content is indifferent to the form; in real ground this is equally true. Now the result of this is, further, that the real ground does not itself indicate which of the manifold determinations ought to be taken as essential.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Something&nbsp;</em>is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete&nbsp;</em>of manifold determinations which show themselves to be equally fixed and permanent in it. One as much as another can therefore be determined as ground, namely,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as essential,&nbsp;</em>compared with which the other is then only a posited. This links up with what has already been mentioned, namely, from the fact that in one case a determination is present as ground of another, it does not follow that this other is posited with it in another case or at all. Punishment, for example, has various determinations: it is retribution, a deterrent example as well, a threat used by the law as a deterrent, and also it brings the criminal to his senses and reforms him. Each of these different determinations has been considered the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground of punishment,&nbsp;</em>because each is an essential determination, and therefore the others, as distinct from it, are determined as merely contingent relatively to it. But the one which is taken as ground is still not the whole punishment itself; this concrete also contains those others which, whilst associated with the ground in the punishment, do not have their ground in the latter. Again, an official has an aptitude for his office, as an individual has relationships with others, has a circle of acquaintances, a particular character, made an appearance in such and such circumstances and on such and such occasions, and so on. Each of these attributes can be, or can be regarded as, the ground for his holding his office; they are a diverse content which is joined together in a third; the form, in which they are determined as being either essential or posited in relation to one another, is external to the content. Each of these attributes is essential to the official because through it he is the specific individual that he is; in so far as the office can be regarded as an external, posited determination, each can be determined as ground relatively to it, but also conversely, they can be regarded as posited and the office as their ground. How they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actually&nbsp;</em>related, that is, in the individual case, this is a determination external to the ground relation and to the content itself; it is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">third&nbsp;</em>that imparts to them the form of ground and grounded.</p>

Therefore whether a ground has this or that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consequent&nbsp;</em>is equally contingent. Moral motives, for example, are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential determinations&nbsp;</em>of the ethical nature, but what follows from them is at the same time an externality distinct from them, which follows and also does not follow from them; it is only through a third that it is attached to them. More accurately this is to be understood in this way, that if the moral motive is a ground, it is not contingent to it whether it has or has not a consequent or a grounded, but it is contingent whether it is or is not made a ground at all. But again, since the content which is the consequent of the moral motive, if this has been made the ground, has the nature of externality, it can be immediately sublated by another externality. Therefore an action may, or may not, issue from a moral motive. Conversely, an action can have various grounds; as a concrete, it contains manifold essential determinations, each of which can therefore be assigned as ground. The search for and assignment of grounds, in which argumentation mainly consists, is accordingly an endless pursuit which does not reach a final determination; for any and every thing one or more good grounds can be given, and also for its opposite; and a host of grounds can exist without anything following from them. What Socrates and Plato call&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sophistry is</em>&nbsp;nothing else but argumentation from grounds; to this, Plato opposes the contemplation of the Idea, that is, of the subject matter in and for itself or in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion.&nbsp;</em>Grounds are taken only from<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential&nbsp;</em>determinations of a content,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential&nbsp;</em>relationships and aspects, and of these every subject matter, just like its opposite, possesses several; in their form of essentiality, one is as valid as another; because it does not embrace the whole extent of the subject matter, each is a one-sided ground, the other particular sides having on their part particular grounds, and none of them exhausts the subject matter which constitutes their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">togetherness&nbsp;</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Verkn&uuml;pfung</em>] and contains them all; none is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sufficient&nbsp;</em>ground, that is, the Notion.</p>

First, something has a ground; it contains&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the determination of the content&nbsp;</em>which is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground,&nbsp;</em>and, in addition&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a second&nbsp;</em>determination, one which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>by the ground. But each is an indifferent content, so that the one determination is not in its own self ground, nor is the other in its own self that which is grounded by the first; the fact is, that in the immediacy of the content, this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>is a sublated or posited relation and has, as such, its ground in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another.&nbsp;</em>This second relation, as different only in respect of form, has the same content as the first, namely, the two determinations of the content, but it is their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate</em>&nbsp;&#39;togetherness&#39;. However, the determinations thus connected constitute a simply varied content, and are therefore determined as indifferent to one another; consequently, this relation is not their truly absolute relation in which one of the determinations would be self-identical in positedness, and the other only this positedness of the same self-identical determination.</p>

The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">two somethings&nbsp;</em>are therefore the two distinct relations of the content which have been brought to view. They stand in the identical ground-relation of form; they are one and the same<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">whole content,&nbsp;</em>namely, the two determinations of the content and their relation; they are distinguished only by the kind of this relation, which in the one is an immediate, in the other a posited relation; through this, they are distinguished one from the other as ground and grounded only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in respect of form.&nbsp;</em>Secondly, this ground-relation is not merely formal, but also real. The formal ground passes over into real ground as we have seen; the moments of form are reflected into themselves; they are a self-subsistent content, and the ground relation also contains one peculiar&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content as ground,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another as grounded.&nbsp;</em>The content, in the first instance, constitutes the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>identity of the two sides of the formal ground which thus have one and the same content. But it also has form within it and is thus a twofold&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content&nbsp;</em>which has the nature of ground and grounded. One of the two determinations of the two somethings is therefore determined as being, not merely common to them as in an external comparison, but as being their identical substrate and the foundation of their relation. As against the other determination of the content, this determination is essential and is the ground of the other which is posited, namely, in the something, of which the grounded determination is the relation. In the first something, which is the ground-relation, this second determination of the content is immediately and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>connected with the first. But the other something only contains the one&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>&nbsp;as that in which it is immediately identical with the first something, but the other as the determination posited in it. The former determination of the content is its ground by virtue of its being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">originally&nbsp;</em>connected with the other determination in. the first something.</p>

In the second something, not only is this second determination a mediated one, but the fact that its immediate determination is ground is also mediated, namely, by its original connection with B in the first something.

But it is positing reflection; as such it makes itself into a positedness and is presupposing reflection; thus it relates itself to itself as to a sublated moment, to an immediate by which it is itself mediated. This mediation, as the progress from the immediate to the ground, is not an external reflection but, as we have seen, the native act of the ground itself, or, what is the same thing, the ground-relation, as reflection into self-identity, is equally essentially self-alienating reflection.

Secondly, this something is related to another, to something that is ground, not of the first something, but in some other respect; for the first something is itself immediate and without a ground. According to that relation it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited;&nbsp;</em>the immediate something ought to be, as condition, not for itself but for something else. But at the same time, the fact that it is thus for another, is itself only a positedness; this fact that it is a posited is sublated in its immediacy, and a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something is indifferent to its being a condition.&nbsp;</em>Thirdly, condition is an immediate in such a manner that it constitutes the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposition&nbsp;</em>of the ground. In this determination it is the form relation of the ground, withdrawn into identity with itself, and is consequently the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content&nbsp;</em>of the ground. But the content as such is only the indifferent unity of the ground, as in form - without form there is no content. Further, it frees itself from this indifferent unity in that, in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">complete&nbsp;</em>ground, the ground relation becomes a relation external to its identity, whereby the content acquires immediacy. In so far, therefore, as condition is that in which the ground-relation has its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-identity,&nbsp;</em>it constitutes the content of the ground; but because the content is indifferent to this form, it is only<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>its content, something which has yet to become content and hence constitutes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">material&nbsp;</em>for the ground. Posited as condition, something has the determination (in accordance with the second moment) of losing its indifferent immediacy and becoming moment of something else. Through its immediacy it is indifferent to this relation; but, in so far as it enters into this relation, it constitutes the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself&nbsp;</em>of the ground and is for the latter the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unconditioned.&nbsp;</em>In order to be condition, it has in the ground its presupposition and is itself conditioned; but this determination is external to it.</p>

Condition is the moment of unconditioned immediacy for the ground, but is not itself the movement and the positing that is negatively self-related and that makes itself into positedness. The ground-relation, therefore, stands over against condition. Something has, apart from its condition, also a ground. This is the empty movement of reflection, because reflection has the immediacy that is its presupposition, outside it. But it is the whole form and the self-subsistent mediating process; for the condition is not its ground. Since this mediating process is, as a positing, self-related, it is from this side also an immediate and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unconditioned;&nbsp;</em>true, it presupposes itself, but as a discarded or sublated positing; on the other hand, what it is according to its determination, that it is in and for itself. In so far as the ground relation is a self-subsistent relation-to-self, and it has within it the identity of reflection, it has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its own peculiar content&nbsp;</em>over against the content of the condition. The former is content of the ground and therefore essentially formed; the latter, on the other hand, is only an immediate material, whose relation to the ground is external to it while, at the same time, it no less constitutes the in-itself of the ground. It is thus a mixture of the self-subsistent content which has no relation to the content of the ground-determination, and of such content that enters into the ground-determination and, as its material, is meant to become a moment of it.</p>

But further, the two sides are also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediated.&nbsp;</em>Condition is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself&nbsp;</em>of the ground; so much is it an essential moment of the ground-relation, that it is the simple self-identity of the ground. But this, too, is sublated; this in-itself is only a positedness; the immediate determinate being is indifferent to the fact that it is condition. The fact, therefore, that the condition is an in-itself for the ground constitutes that side of it which makes it mediated. Similarly, the ground-relation, in its self-subsistence, also has a presupposition, and has its in-itself outside it. Thus each of the two sides is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contradiction&nbsp;</em>of indifferent immediacy and essential mediation, both in a single relation-or the contradiction of self subsistent existence and the determination of being only a moment.</p>

Both sides of the form are external to the immediate determinate being; for this is the sublated ground relation. But, first, determinate being is in its own self only this, to sublate itself in its immediacy and to fall to the ground [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">zugrunde zu gehen</em>]<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">. Being&nbsp;</em>is simply only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming</em>&nbsp;of essence; it is its essential nature to make itself into a positedness and into an identity which, through negation of itself, is the immediate. The form-determinations, therefore, of positedness and of the self-identical in-itself, the form through which the immediate determinate being is condition, are therefore not external to it; on the contrary, it is this reflection itself. Secondly, as condition, being is now also posited as that which it essentially is, namely, as moment, hence as moment of an other, and at the same time, as an in-itself, likewise of an other; but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>being only is through the negation of itself, namely, through ground and through ground&#39;s self-sublating, and therefore presupposing, reflection; the in-itself of being is accordingly only a posited. This in-itself of condition has two sides: one is its essentiality as essentiality of the ground, while the other is the immediacy of its determinate being. Or rather, both are the same. Determinate being is an immediate, but the immediacy is essentially the mediated, namely, through the self-sublating ground. As this immediacy that is mediated by a self-sublating process of mediation, it is at the same time the in-itself of the ground and the unconditioned of its unconditioned side; but this in-itself is itself in turn also no less only a moment or a positedness, for it is mediated. Condition is accordingly the whole form of the ground relation; it is its presupposed in-itself, but as presupposed it is itself a positedness and its immediacy is this, to make itself into a positedness and so to repel itself from itself, in such a manner that it both falls to the ground and is ground, the ground making itself into a positedness and thus also into a grounded, and these two are one and the same thing.</p>

This ground is the self-subsistent, that is, the self-relating, reflection of the positing, and consequently the self-identical; or, it is in its own self its in-itself and its content. But it is also presupposing reflection; it is negatively related to itself and opposes its in-itself to itself as to an other, and condition, according to its moment of in-itself as well as according to its moment of immediate determinate being, is the ground-relation&#39;s own moment; the immediate determinate being is essentially only through its ground and is moment of itself as a presupposing. This ground, therefore, is equally the whole itself.</p>

For the peculiar content of condition is essential content only in so far as it is the self-identity of reflection in the form, or, as this immediate determinate being is in its own self the ground-relation. Further, this immediate determinate being is only condition through the presupposing reflection of the ground; it is the self-identity of the ground, or its content, to which it opposes itself. Therefore the determinate being is not merely formless material for the ground relation; on the contrary, because it has in its own self this form it is a formed matter, and since also in its identity with it it is indifferent to it, it is content. Finally, it is the same content as that possessed by ground, for it is content precisely as that which is self-identical in the form relation.</p>

They spontaneously pass over into one another or, since they are reflections, they posit themselves as sublated, relate themselves to this their negation and<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reciprocally presuppose one another.&nbsp;</em>But at the same time this is only a single reflection of both and therefore their presupposing is also only one; or rather this reciprocal presupposing becomes a presupposing of their one identity as their subsistence and substrate. This identity of their common content and unity of form is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">truly unconditioned, the fact in its own self.&nbsp;</em>As we saw above, condition is only the relatively unconditioned. It is therefore usually regarded as itself conditioned and a fresh condition is asked for, and thus the usual&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite progress&nbsp;</em>from condition to condition is introduced. Now why does a condition prompt us to ask for a fresh condition, that is, why is a condition regarded as a conditioned? Because it is some finite determinate being or other. But this is a further determination, which is not contained in its Notion. Condition as such is conditioned, solely because it is a posited in-itself; it is therefore sublated in the absolutely unconditioned.</p>

Now as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground,&nbsp;</em>it is the negative identity that has repelled itself into these two moments; first, into the shape of the sublated ground relation, of an immediate, self-external manifoldness, without unity, which relates itself to the ground as something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>to it, and at the same time constitutes the ground&#39;s in-itself; secondly, into the shape of an internal, simple form, which is ground, but relates itself to the self-identical immediate as to an other and determines it as condition, that is, determines this its in-itself as its own moment. These two sides&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presuppose&nbsp;</em>the totality in such a manner that it is that which posits them.

But since these two sides have shown themselves to be an identity, the relation of condition and ground has vanished; they are reduced to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an illusory being;&nbsp;</em>the absolutely unconditioned in its movement of positing and presupposing is only the movement in which this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">illusory being&nbsp;</em>sublates itself. It is the fact&#39;s own act to condition itself and to oppose itself as ground to its conditions; but its relation, as a relation between conditions and ground, is a reflection&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">into itself,&nbsp;</em>and its relation to them is its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">union with itself.</em></p>

As&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground,&nbsp;</em>it relates itself negatively to itself, makes itself into a positedness; but this positedness is a reflection that is complete in both its aspects and a form-relation that is self-identical in them as we have seen from their Notion. This positedness is accordingly, first, the sublated ground, the fact as the reflectionless immediate-the side of conditions. This is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">totality&nbsp;</em>of the determinations of the fact-the fact itself, but cast out into the externality of being, the restored sphere of being. In condition, essence releases the unity of its reflection-into-self as an immediacy, which however from now on has the character of being a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">conditioning</em>&nbsp;presupposition and of essentially constituting only one of the sides of essence. The conditions are, therefore, the whole content of the fact, because they are the unconditioned in the form of formless being. But they also have, by reason of this form, another shape besides the determinations of the content as it is in the fact as such. They appear as a multiplicity without unity, mixed with non-essentials and other circumstances that do not belong to the sphere of determinate being in so far as this constitutes the conditions of this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific&nbsp;</em>fact. For the absolute, unrestricted fact, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sphere of being itself&nbsp;</em>is the condition. The ground, which withdraws into itself, posits condition as the first immediacy and it relates itself to this as to its unconditioned. This immediacy as sublated reflection is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reflection&nbsp;</em>in the element of being, which thus develops itself as such into a whole; the form, as a determinateness of being, goes on to multiply itself and thus appears as a manifold content distinct from and indifferent to the determination of reflection. The unessential, which belongs to the sphere of being and which the latter, in so far as it is condition, strips off, is the determinateness of immediacy in which the unity of form is submerged. This form unity, as the relation of being, is present in it at first as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming-the&nbsp;</em>transition of one determinateness of being into another. But the becoming of being is further the transition to essence and the withdrawal into ground. The determinate being, therefore, that constitutes the conditions is, in truth, not determined as condition by something else and used by it as material; on the contrary, it is through its own act that it makes itself into a moment of another. Also, far from its becoming starting from itself as the true first and immediate, the truth is that its immediacy is only something presupposed, and the movement of its becoming is the act of reflection itself. Accordingly the truth of determinate being is to be condition; its immediacy is, solely through the reflection of the ground-relation which posits itself as sublated. Becoming is, therefore, like immediacy, only the illusory being of the unconditioned, in that this presupposes itself and therein has its form; and the immediacy of being is accordingly essentially only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moment&nbsp;</em>of the form.</p>

But it is the form of the absolute fact, and it possesses within itself the unity of its form with itself, or its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content;&nbsp;</em>and in the very act of determining this content to be condition it sublates the diversity of the content and reduces it to a moment, just as, conversely, as essenceless form it gives itself the immediacy of a subsistence in this self-identity. The reflection of the ground sublates the immediacy of the conditions and relates them, so making them moments in the unity of the fact; but the conditions are presupposed by the unconditioned fact itself, which thus sublates its own positing, or its positing directly converts itself equally into a becoming. The two are therefore one unity; the immanent movement of the conditions is a becoming, a withdrawal into ground to the positing of ground; but the ground as posited, that is to say, as sublated, is the immediate. The ground relates itself negatively to itself, makes itself into a positedness and grounds the conditions; but in thus determining immediate determinate being as a posited, the ground sublates it and thereby first constitutes itself ground. This reflection is accordingly the mediation of the unconditioned fact with itself through its negation. Or rather, the reflection of the unconditioned is at first a presupposing-but this sublating of itself is immediately a positing which determines; secondly, in this presupposing, reflection is immediately a sublating of what is presupposed and a determining from within itself; thus this determining is again a sublating of the positing and is in its own self a becoming. In this, the mediation as a return-to-self through negation has vanished; it is the simple, internal movement of reflection [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">einfache, in sich scheinende Reflexion</em>] and groundless absolute becoming. The movement of the fact to become posited, on the one hand through its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">conditions,&nbsp;</em>and on the other through its ground, is merely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vanishing of the illusion of mediation.&nbsp;</em>The process by which the fact is posited is accordingly an emergence, the simple entry of the fact&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">into Existence,&nbsp;</em>the pure movement of the fact to itself.</p>

But this makes the ground a posited ground, that is, it is just as much sublated ground and immediate being, as it is ground. When therefore all the conditions of the fact are present, they sublate themselves as immediate being and presupposition, and equally ground sublates itself. Ground emerges merely as an illusory being that immediately vanishes; accordingly, this emergence is the tautological movement of the fact to itself, and its mediation by conditions and ground is the vanishing of both. The emergence into Existence is therefore immediate in such a manner that it is mediated only by the vanishing of mediation.</p>

But it receives this not as something external, nor through an external relation; on the contrary, as ground, it makes itself into a positedness, its simple essentiality unites with itself in the positedness and is, in this sublation of itself, the vanishing of its difference from its positedness, and is thus simple essential immediacy.

The various kinds of being demand or imply their own kind of mediation, so that the nature of proof too, will differ in respect of each</span>. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ontological proof</em>&nbsp;proposes to start from the Notion; it makes the sum total of all realities its basis and then proceeds to subsume existence, too, under reality. It is therefore the mediation that is syllogism and that does not as yet come up for consideration here. We have already considered above Kant&#39;s objections to this proof and have remarked that Kant understands by Existence, the determinate being whereby something enters into the context of the totality of experience, that is, into the determination of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">otherness&nbsp;</em>and into relation to an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other.&nbsp;</em>Thus something, as existent, is mediated by an other, and existence in general is the side of its mediation. Now what Kant calls a concept, namely, something taken as only simply&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-related,&nbsp;</em>or conception as such, does not contain its mediation; in abstract self-identity, opposition is left out. The ontological proof would now have to demonstrate that the absolute concept, namely the concept of God, attains to a determinate being, to a mediation, or how simple essence mediates itself with mediation. This is effected by the stated subsumption of existence under its universal, namely, reality, which is assumed as the middle term between God in his concept, on the one hand, and existence on the other. This mediation, in so far as it has the form of a syllogism, is, as we have said, not under discussion here. But the preceding exposition has shown what is the true nature of this mediation of essence with Existence. The nature of proof itself will be considered in the doctrine of cognition. Here we have only to indicate what is relevant to the nature of mediation in general.</p>

It is not supposed to be an objective ground of God&#39;s existence; for this existence is in and for itself. Thus it is merely a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground for cognition.&nbsp;</em>It thereby declares itself to be a ground that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vanishes&nbsp;</em>in the object which at first appears to be grounded by it. Now the ground that is derived from the contingency of the world implies the regress of the contingency into absolute essence; for the contingent is that which is in itself&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">groundless&nbsp;</em>and self-sublating. In this way, therefore, absolute essence does in fact proceed from the groundless; the ground sublates itself and with this there also vanishes the illusion of the relation that was given to God, to be that which is grounded in an other. This mediation is therefore true mediation. But this nature of its mediation is unknown to that ratiocinative [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beweisende</em>] reflection; on the one hand, it takes itself to be something merely subjective and by so doing removes its mediation from God himself, but, on the other hand, it does not for that reason recognise the mediating movement, that it is and how it is in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essence itself.&nbsp;</em>Its true relationship consists in this, that it is both of these things in one: mediation as such but, of course, at the same time a subjective, external, that is, self-external, mediation, which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sublates itself again within itself.&nbsp;</em>But in the above proof, existence is given the false relationship of appearing only as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediated&nbsp;</em>or posited.</p>

This is also evident from the foregoing; only we must add that reflection, in ending with the sublating of itself, does not therefore have for result&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothing&nbsp;</em>(for in that case the positive knowledge of essence as an<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>relation to it would be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">separate&nbsp;</em>from that result and a spontaneous emergence, an act starting only from itself); on the contrary, this end itself, this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">falling to the ground&nbsp;</em>of the mediation, is at the same time the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground</em>&nbsp;from which the immediate proceeds.

It falls to the ground and thus itself becomes essential identity or thing-in-itself. This can also be considered in the following manner: essenceless Existence has in the thing-in-itself its reflection-into-self; it is related to it in the first instance as to its other; but as the other over against that which is in itself, it is the sublating of its own self and the becoming of being-in-self.

The thing-in-itself is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-related,&nbsp;</em>essential Existence; it is identity-with-self only in so far as it contains within itself the negativity of reflection-into-itself; consequently that which appeared as an Existence external to it is a moment within it.

This unessential Existence is their relation to one another as to others; but further, it is essential to these others themselves-or, in other words, this unessential Existence in collapsing within itself is a thing-in-itself, but an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>than the first thing-in-itself; for the former is an immediate essentiality, the latter, however, the essentiality that has emerged from unessential Existence.

The things-in-themselves are thus the extremes of a syllogism whose middle term constitutes their external Existence, the Existence through which they are others for one another and distinct from one another. This their difference falls&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only in their relation;</em>&nbsp;they send, as it were, determinations only from their surface into the relation and remain themselves, as absolutely reflected into themselves, indifferent towards the relation. Now this relationship constitutes the totality of Existence. The thing-in-itself stands in relation to a reflection external to it in which it possesses a multiplicity of determinations; this is the repelling of itself from itself into another thing-in-itself; this repelling is the counter-thrust of itself internally, since each is only an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other,&nbsp;</em>as a reflecting of itself out of the other; it has its positedness not in its own self but in the other, is determined only by the determinateness of the other; this other is equally determined only by the determinateness of the first. But the two things-in-themselves, since thus they do not contain the difference within themselves but each has it only in the other, are not distinguished from one another; the thing-in-itself, since it is supposed to be related to the other extreme as to another thing-in-itself, is related to it as something that is not distinguished from it, and the external reflection, which should constitute the mediating connection between the extremes, is only a relating of the thing-&#39;n-itself to itself, or essentially its reflection into itself; it is therefore only an implicit determinateness, or the determinateness of the thing-in-itself. The thing-in-itself, therefore, has the determinateness, not in a relation (external to it) to another thing-in-itself, and of this other to it; the determinateness is not merely a surface of the thing-in-itself but is the essential mediation of itself with itself as with an other. The two things-inthemselves which are supposed to constitute the extremes of the relation, since they are supposed not to possess in themselves any determinateness over against one another,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intact collapse into one;</em>&nbsp;there is only one thing-in-itself, which in external reflection is related to itself, and it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its own self-relation as to an other&nbsp;</em>that constitutes its determinateness.</p>

In this consciousness of its freedom the ego is to itself that true identity reflected into itself, which the thing-in-itself was supposed to be. 1 have shown elsewhere that this transcendental idealism does not get away from the limitation of the ego by the object, in general, from the finite world, but only changes the form of the limitation, which remains for it an absolute, merely giving it a subjective instead of an objective shape and making into determinatenesses of the ego and into a turbulent whirlpool of change within it (as if the ego were a thing) that which the ordinary consciousness knows as a manifoldness and alteration belonging only to things external to it. At present we are considering only the thing-in-itself and the reflection which is in the first instance external to it; this reflection has not yet determined itself to consciousness, nor the thing-in-itself to ego. We have seen from the nature of the thing-in-itself and of external reflection that this same external reflection determines itself to be the thing-in-itself, or, conversely, becomes the first thing-in-itself&#39;s own determination.</p>

Thinghood is thus reduced to the form of indeterminate identity-with-self which has its essentiality only in its property. If, therefore, one is speaking of a thing or things in general without any determinate property, then their difference is merely indifferent, quantitative. What is considered as one thing can equally be made into or considered as several things; the separation or union of them is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external.&nbsp;</em>A book is a thing and each of its leaves is also a thing, and so too is each bit of its pages, and so on to infinity. The determinateness through which one thing is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this&nbsp;</em>thing only, lies solely in its properties. Through them it distinguishes itself from other things, because property is negative reflection and a distinguishing; the thing therefore contains the difference of itself from other things solely in its property. This is the difference reflected into itself, through which the thing, in its positedness, that is, in its relation to another, is at the same time indifferent to the other and to its relation to it. All that remains therefore to the thing without its properties is abstract being-in-self or initselfness, an unessential compass and external holding together. The true in-itself is the in-itself in its positedness: and this is property. With this,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thinghood has passed over into property.</em></p>

This, therefore, is not that which is sublated in the thing, nor is it the thing&#39;s mere moment; on the contrary, the thing is, in truth, only that unessential compass which, though a negative unity, is only like the one of something, namely an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>one. Previously the thing was determined as an unessential compass in so far as it was made such by external abstraction which strips it of its property; but now this abstraction has happened through the transition of the thing-in-itself into property itself, but with inversion of the values: whereas in the former act of abstraction the abstract thing without its property was still vaguely conceived of as the essential, but the property as an external determination, here the thing as such spontaneously determines itself into an indifferent external form of the property.

Equally current is the expression that things&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consist of</em>&nbsp;various matters. One is careful not to call these matters things; although it would certainly be admitted that, e.g. a pigment is a thing; but I do not know whether e.g. luminous matter, heat matter or electrical matter and so on, are also called things. Things and their constituents are distinguished without it being exactly stated whether and to what extent the latter are also things or perhaps only half things; but they are at least existents in general.</p>

But at the same time, the reflection of property into itself constitutes only one side of the whole reflection; namely, the sublating of the difference and the continuity of the property (which was supposed to be an Existence for an other) with itself. Thinghood, as negative reflection-into-self and a distinguishing which repels itself from an other, is thereby reduced to an unessential moment; but in this process it has at the same time further determined itself. First, this negative moment has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">preserved&nbsp;</em>itself; for property has become continuous with itself and a self-subsistent matter only in so far as the difference of things has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sublated&nbsp;</em>itself; the continuity of the property into otherness therefore itself contains the moment of the negative, and its self-subsistence is, as this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative unity,</em>&nbsp;the restored&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something&nbsp;</em>of thinghood; the negative self-subsistence over against the positive of matter. Secondly, through this the thing has advanced from its indeterminateness to complete determinateness. As&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thing-in-itself&nbsp;</em>it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract&nbsp;</em>identity, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simply negative&nbsp;</em>Existence, or Existence&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determined&nbsp;</em>as the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indeterminate;</em>&nbsp;next, the thing is determined by its properties, by which it is supposed to be distinguished from other things; but it is, in fact, through property that it is continuous with other things and consequently this incomplete difference sublates itself. Through this the thing has returned into itself and is now determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate;&nbsp;</em>it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself determinate or this&nbsp;</em>thing.</p>

Property is not only an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external</em>determination but an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intrinsic&nbsp;</em>Existence. This unity of externality and essentiality, because it contains reflection-into-self and reflection-into-an-other, repels itself from itself, and is, on the one hand, determination as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple,&nbsp;</em>self-identical, self-related self-subsistence in which the negative unity, the one of the thing, is sublated; on the other hand, it is this determination over against an other, but likewise as a one reflected into itself and intrinsically determinate; it is therefore the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">matters and this thing.&nbsp;</em>These are the two moments of the externality which is identical with itself, or of the property reflected into itself. Property was that by which things were supposed to be distinguished; but now that it has freed itself from this its negative side, of inhering in an other, the thing, too, has been freed from its being determined by other things and has returned into itself from the relation to other; but it is at the same time only the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thing-in-itself that has become an other to itself,&nbsp;</em>because the manifold properties on their part have become independent and therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">their negative relation in the one of the thing&nbsp;</em>is only a sublated relation. For this reason, the thing is a self-identical negation only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as against&nbsp;</em>the positive continuity of the matter.</p>

The thing consists of self-subsistent matters which are indifferent to their relation in the thing.

They pass&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">out of and beyond this&nbsp;</em>thing, continue themselves into other things, and the fact that they belong to this thing is not a limitation for them; and just as little are they a limitation for one another, because their negative relation is only the impotent &#39;this&#39;. Therefore in their combination in the latter they do not sublate themselves; as self-subsistent they are impenetrable for one another, relate themselves in their determinateness only to themselves, and are a mutually indifferent manifoldness of subsistence; they are capable only of a quantitative limit.

The thing, namely, is determined as an external collection of self-subsistent matters; these matters are not things, they do not have negative self-subsistence; but they are the properties as self-subsistents, that is, they are determinate and the determinateness is, as such, reflected into itself.

The matters are therefore essentially porous, so that one subsists in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pores&nbsp;</em>or in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-stibsistence&nbsp;</em>of the others; but these others are themselves porous; in their pores or non-subsistence the first and all the others also subsist; their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsistence&nbsp;</em>is at the same time their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sublatedness</em>&nbsp;and the subsistence of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">others;&nbsp;</em>and this subsistence of the others is equally this their sublatedness and the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsistence of the first,&nbsp;</em>and in the same way of all the others. The thing is, therefore, the selfcontradictory mediation of independent self-subsistence through its opposite, namely, through its negation, or of one self-subsistent matter through the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsistence and non-subsistence&nbsp;</em>of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other.&nbsp;</em>In&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this thing,&nbsp;</em>Existence has reached its completion, namely, it is intrinsic being or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">independent&nbsp;</em>subsistence, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unessential&nbsp;</em>Existence&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in one;&nbsp;</em>hence the truth of Existence is to have its being-in-self in unessentiality, or its subsisting in an other, and that, too, the absolute other, or that it has its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">own nullity&nbsp;</em>for substrate.

Both properties and matters are the same&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content-determinations;&nbsp;</em>only in the former case they are moments, that is, they are reflected into their negative unity as into a substrate distinct from them, namely,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thinghood,&nbsp;</em>and in the latter case they are self-subsistent, different determinations, each of which is reflected into its own unity-with-self. These matters are now further determined as an independent subsistence; but they are also together in a thing. This thing has the two determinations of being first,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this&nbsp;</em>thing, and secondly, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&#39;also&#39;.&nbsp;</em>The &#39;also&#39; is that which presents itself in external intuition as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">spatial extension;&nbsp;</em>but the &#39;this&#39;, the negative unity, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">puncticity</em>&nbsp;of the thing. The matters are together in the puncticity, and their talso&#39; or the extension is everywhere this puncticity; for the &#39;also&#39; as thinghood is essentially also determined as a negative unity. Therefore where one of these matters is, the other also is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in one and the same point;&nbsp;</em>the thing does not have its colour in one place, its odorific matter in another, its heat matter in a third, and so on, but in the point in which it is warm, it is also coloured, sour, electric, and so on. Now because these matters are not outside one another but are in one &#39;this&#39;, they are assumed to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">porous,&nbsp;</em>so that one exists in the interstices of the other. But that which is present in the interstices of the other matter is itself porous; conversely, therefore, in its pores the other exists; but not only this matter but the third, tenth, and so on. They are all porous and in the interstices of each all the others are present, just as each, with all the rest, is present in the pores of every other. Accordingly they are a multiplicity which interpenetrate one another in such a manner that those which penetrate are equally penetrated by the others, so that each again penetrates its own penetratedness. Each is posited as its negation, and this negation is the subsistence of another; but this subsistence is equally the negation of this other, and the subsistence of the first.</p>

For pictorial thinking, in the first place contains the contradiction of wanting to hold on to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">perception&nbsp;</em>and to have before it things that have real being, and secondly, of ascribing a sensible existence to the imperceptible, to what is determined by reflection; the minute parts and pores are at the same time supposed to be a sensible existence and their positedness is spoken of as if it had the same kind of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reality&nbsp;</em>as that which belongs to colour, heat, etc. If, further, pictorial thinking considered more closely this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objective&nbsp;</em>nebulosity, the pores and the minute particles, it would recognise in it not only a matter and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">also&nbsp;</em>its negation, so that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">here&nbsp;</em>there would be matter and<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alongside&nbsp;</em>it its negation, the pore, and alongside this, matter again, and so on, but also that in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this&nbsp;</em>thing it has,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in one and the same point,</em><span class="point1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;</span><em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistent&nbsp;</em>matter, and&nbsp;<span class="point1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">(2)</span>&nbsp;its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation&nbsp;</em>or porosity and the other&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistent&nbsp;</em>matter, and that this porosity and the independent subsistence of the matters in one another as in a single point is a reciprocal negation and a penetration of the penetration.</p>

They show, namely, that for example a certain volume takes up the same amount of steam whether it is empty of atmospheric air or filled with it; and also that the various gases diffuse themselves in one another in such a manner that each is as good as a vacuum for the other, or at least that they are not in any kind of chemical combination with one another, each remains uninterrupted by the other and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continuous with itself and in its interpenetration with the others keeps itself indifferent&nbsp;</em>to them. But the further moment in the Notion of the thing is that in this thing one matter is present where the other matter is, and the matter that penetrates is also penetrated in the same point; in other words, the self-subsistent is immediately the self-subsistence of an other. This is contradictory; but the thing is nothing else but this very contradiction; and that is why it is Appearance.</p>

Spirit is, in a much deeper sense this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one thing,&nbsp;</em>the negative unity in which its determinations interpenetrate one another. But when it is thought of as soul, it is quite frequently taken as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thing.&nbsp;</em>Just as man in general is made to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consist&nbsp;</em>of soul and body, each of which has an independent being of its own, so too the soul is made to consist of so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">soul-forces,&nbsp;</em>each of which has a self-subsistence of its own, or is an immediate, separate activity with its own peculiar nature. It is imagined that the intellect acts separately in one place and the imagination by itself in another, that intellect, memory, and so on, are each cultivated separately, and for the time being the other forces are left inactive on one side until perhaps, or perhaps not, their turn comes.

But spirit is not that contradiction which the thing is, which dissolves itself and passes over into Appearance; on the contrary, it is already in its own self the contradiction that has returned into its absolute unity, namely, the Notion, in which the differences are no longer to be thought of as independent, but only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as particular,&nbsp;</em>moments in the subject, in the simple individuality.</p>

In other words, the existent is, as an Appearance, reflected into an other which it has for its ground, which other is itself only this, to be reflected into an other. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential&nbsp;</em>self-subsistence which belongs to it because it is a return-into-self is the return of the nothing through nothing back to itself on account of the negativity of the moments; the self-subsistence of the existent is, therefore, only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential illusory show</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">wesentliche Schein</em>]. The connection of the reciprocally grounding existents consists therefore in this reciprocal negation, namely, that the subsistence of the one is not the subsistence of the other, but is its positedness, which relation of the positedness alone constitutes the subsistence of the existents. The ground is present as it is in truth, namely, to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a first&nbsp;</em>that is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only presupposed.</em></p>

According to the first side it is a determinate being, but one which is contingent, unessential and, in keeping with its immediacy, is subject to transition, coming-tobe and ceasing-to-be.

In law two content determinations are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essentially&nbsp;</em>connected (for instance, in the law of descent of a falling body, spatial and temporal magnitudes: spaces passed through vary as the squares of the times elapsed); they are connected; this relation is at first only an immediate one. It is, therefore, likewise at first only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>relation, the immediate in general having obtained in Appearance the meaning of positedness. The essential unity of the two sides of the law would be their negativity, that is to say, the one would contain its other within itself; but this essential unity has not yet emerged in the law. (That is why the Notion of the space traversed by a falling body does not itself imply that time corresponds to it as a square. Because fall is a sensible movement it is the relation of time and space; but first, the determination of time-that is, time as it is commonly imagined-does not itself imply its relationship to space, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vice versa;&nbsp;</em>it is said that time can quite well be imagined without space and space without time; thus the one comes only externally into relation with the other, which external relation is motion. Secondly, the further determination is indifferent, namely, the magnitudes in accordance with which space and time are related in motion. The law of this relationship is empirically ascertained and in so far it is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate;&nbsp;</em>it still demands a proof, that is, a mediation for cognition, showing that the law not only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">occurs&nbsp;</em>but is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessary</em>; the law as such does not contain this proof and its objective necessity.) Law is, therefore, only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the positive,&nbsp;</em>and not the negative, essentiality of Appearance. In the latter, the content determinations are moments of form, as such passing over into their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>and in themselves are equally not themselves but their other. Accordingly, though in law the positedness of one side of it is the positedness of the other, their content is indifferent to this relation: the content does not itself therefore, is indeed essential form, contain this positedness.&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">Law, therefore, is indeed essential form, but not as yet real form, which is reflected into its sides as content</span>.</p>

Law is this simple identity of Appearance with itself and therefore its substrate, not its ground; for it is not the negative unity of Appearance but, as its simple identity, the immediate, that is abstract unity,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alongside</em>which therefore its other content also occurs. The content is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this&nbsp;</em>content, internally coherent, or has its negative reflection within itself.

The content of Appearance which is distinct from the content of law is the existent, which has its negativity for its ground or is reflected into its non-being.

But as a phenomenon it is essentially&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reflected into its non-being,&nbsp;</em>or its identity is itself essentially no less its negativity and its other. Therefore the reflection-into-self of Appearance, namely law, is not only the identical substrate of Appearance, but the latter also has its opposite in law and law is its negative unity.</p>

At first, it is merely a diverse content and the formal reflection of positedness into itself, so that the positedness of one of its sides is the positedness of the other. But because it is also negative reflection-into-self, its sides are in their relationship not merely different but are negatively related to each other. Or, when law is considered merely on its own, the sides of its content are indifferent to each other; but equally they are sublated by their identity; the positedness of one is the positedness of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other,&nbsp;</em>and therefore the subsistence of each is also the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-subsistence of itself.&nbsp;</em>This positedness of one in the other is their negative unity and each is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not only the positedness of itself but also of the other,&nbsp;</em>or, each is itself this negative unity. The positive identity which they have in law as such is at first only their inner unity which stands in need of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proof and mediation,&nbsp;</em>because this negative is not as yet posited in them. But since the different sides of law are now determined as being different in their negative unity, or such that each of them contains its other within it, and at the same time, as a self-subsistent side, repels this its otherness from itself, the identity of law is therefore now also a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited and&nbsp;</em>real identity.</p>

Existence has thus completely withdrawn into itself and has reflected itself into its absolute otherness in and for itself. That which was previously law is accordingly no longer only one side of the whole whose other side was Appearance as such, but is itself the whole. Existence is the essential totality of Appearance, so that it now contains the moment of unessentiality which still belonged to Appearance, but as reflected, implicit unessentiality, that is, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential negativity.&nbsp;</em>As an immediate content, law is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>in general, distinguished from other laws, and of these there is an indeterminable number. But since it now has within it essential negativity it no longer contains such a merely indifferent, contingent content determination; on the contrary, its content is all determinateness whatsoever, in an essential relation developing itself into totality. Thus Appearance which is reflected into itself is now a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">world,</em>&nbsp;which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reveals&nbsp;</em>itself as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">world in and for itself&nbsp;</em>above the world&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of Appearance.</em></p>

But now since it is the total reflection of this world it also contains the moment of its essenceless manifoldness. This moment of alterableness and alteration as reflected into self, as essential, is absolute negativity or pure form as such, whose moments however in the world in and for itself have the reality of self-subsistent but reflected Existence; just as, conversely, this reflected self-subsistence now has form within itself, by virtue of which its content is not a merely manifold, but an essentially self-coherent, content.</p>

It is only as things of another, supersensuous world that things are posited first, as veritable Existences, and secondly as the true in contrast to what has simply affirmative being; in them it is acknowledged that there is a being distinct from immediate being, a being that is veritable Existence. On the one hand, the sensuous representation which ascribes Existence only to the immediate being of feeling and intuition is overcome in this determination; but, on the other hand, there is also in it unconscious reflection which, though having the conception of things, forces, the inner, and so on, does not know that such determinations are not sensuous or simply affirmative immediacies, but reflected Existences.</p>

It contains opposition and repels itself within itself into the essential world and into the world of otherness or the world of Appearance. Thus, because it is totality, it is also only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one side</em>&nbsp;of it, and in this determination constitutes a self-subsistence distinct from the world of Appearance. The world of Appearance has in the essential world its negative unity in which it falls to the ground and into which it withdraws as into its ground. Further, the essential world is. also the positing ground of the world of Appearance; for, containing the absolute form in its essentiality, its identity sublates itself, makes itself into positedness and as this posited immediacy is the world of Appearance.</p>

As the realm of laws, it is already a manifold content, namely, the essential content of the world of Appearance, and as ground with a content, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>ground of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>world, but only in respect of this content; for the world of Appearance still had other manifold content than the realm of laws, because the negative moment was still peculiarly its own. But since the realm of laws now likewise contains this moment, it is the totality of the content of the world of Appearance and the ground of all its manifoldness. But it is at the same time the negative of this totality and as such is the world&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposed&nbsp;</em>to it. That is to say, in the identity of both worlds, one of them is determined in respect of form as essential and the other as the same world but as posited and unessential, so that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground relation&nbsp;</em>has, it is true, been restored; but it is also the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground relation of Appearance,</em>&nbsp;namely, as relation not of an identical content, nor of a merely diverse one, as is law, but as total relation, or as negative identity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">and essential relation of the opposed sides of the content.&nbsp;</em>The realm of laws is not only this, that the positedness of a content is the positedness of another, but this identity is essentially, as we have seen, also a negative unity; each of the two sides of law is, in the negative unity,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own self its other&nbsp;</em>content; accordingly the other is not an indeterminate other in general, but is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its&nbsp;</em>other, or, it too contains the content determination of the first; and thus the two sides are opposed. Now since the realm of Laws contains within it this negative moment and opposition, and hence as totality repels itself from itself into a world in and for itself and a world of Appearance, the identity of both is thus the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential relation of opposition.&nbsp;</em>The ground relation as such is the opposition which, in its contradiction, has fallen to the ground; and Existence is the ground that has united&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with itself</em>. But Existence becomes Appearance; ground is sublated in Existence; it reinstates itself as the return of Appearance into itself, but at the same time as sublated ground, namely, as ground relation of opposed determinations; but the identity of such determinations is essentially a becoming and a transition, no longer the ground relation as such.</p>

The relation has sides because it is reflection into an other; thus it contains within itself its own difference, and the sides are a self-dependent subsistence, since in their mutually indifferent diversity they are disrupted within themselves, so that the subsistence of either side equally has its meaning only in relation to the other or in their negative unity.</p>

The reflective determinations of positive and negative are likewise reflected into themselves only as reflected into their opposites; but they have no other determination but this their negative unity. The sides of the essential relation, on the other hand, are posited as self-subsistent totalities. It is the same opposition as that of positive and negative, but at the same time as an inverted world. The side of the essential relation is a totality which, however, as essentially an opposite, has a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beyond&nbsp;</em>of itself; it is only Appearance; its Existence is not its own, but rather that of its other. It is therefore disrupted within itself; but this its sublatedness consists in its being the unity of itself and its other, therefore a whole, and precisely for this reason it has self-subsistent Existence and is essential reflection-into-self.</p>

This self-subsistence which is reflected into itself is at the same time reflection into its opposite, namely,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>self-subsistence; and its subsistence is essentially as much this identity with its opposite as it is its own self-subsistence. Secondly, with this identity the other side, too, is immediately posited: the immediate self-subsistence which, determined as the other, is within itself a manifold variety, but such that this manifoldness essentially also has within it the relation of the other side, the unity of the reflected self-subsistence. The first side, the whole, is the self-subsistence which constituted the world in and for itself; the second side, the parts, is the immediate Existence which was the world of Appearance. In the relationship of whole and parts the two sides are these self-subsistences but in such a manner that each has the other reflected in it and at the same time only is as this identity of both. Now because the essential relation is at first only the first, immediate relation, the negative unity and the positive self-subsistence are connected by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&#39;also&#39;;&nbsp;</em>both sides are indeed posited as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moments, but equally&nbsp;</em>as existent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistences.&nbsp;</em>Accordingly the distribution of these two posited moments is as follows. First, the whole, the reflected self-subsistence, is an existent; and the other, the immediate self-subsistence, is in it as moment-here the whole, the unity of both sides, constitutes the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substrata,&nbsp;</em>and the immediate Existence is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positedness.&nbsp;</em>Conversely, on the other side, namely the side of the parts, the immediate, internally manifold Existence, is the self-subsistent substrate; on the other hand the reflected unity, the whole, is only an external relation.</p>

But because they are the self-subsistent, this relation is only an external moment towards which they are, in and for themselves, indifferent. But at the same time the parts, as a manifold Existence, collapse within themselves, for this Existence is reflectionless being; they have their self-subsistence only in the reflected unity which is both this unity and also the existent manifoldness; that is to say, they have self-subsistence only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in the whole,&nbsp;</em>but at the same time, the whole is a self-subsistent other to the parts.</p>

Now in so far as in this consideration we start from force as negative unity of itself and therefore as presupposing reflection, this is the same as when, in the expression of force, we start from the soliciting impulse.

But the Notion of force is simply the identity of positing and presupposing reflection, or of reflected and immediate unity; and each of these determinations is simply a moment, in unity, and thus is mediated by the other. But equally there is nothing in the two reciprocally related forces to determine which is to be the soliciting and which the solicited force; or rather both form determinations belong in the same manner to each. But this identity is not merely an external identity of comparison but an essential unity of the two.</p>

But they are essentially mediated. One of the forces is solicited; this impulse is a determination posited in it from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside.&nbsp;</em>But force itself is the presupposing reflection; essentially it reflects itself into itself and sublates the fact that the impulse is external. Accordingly, the fact that it is solicited is its own act, or, it is through its own determining that the other force is simply other and is the soliciting force. The soliciting force is negatively related to its other and so sublates the latter&#39;s externality, and in doing so it has a positing action; but it has this only by virtue of the presupposition of having another over against it; that is, it is itself soliciting only in so far as it has in it an externality, hence in so far as it is solicited. Or it solicits only in so far as it is solicited to solicit. And so, conversely, the first force is solicited only in so far as it itself solicits the other to solicit it, namely, the first force. Each of the two therefore receives the impulse from the other; but the impulse which it gives as active force consists in its receiving an impulse from the other; the impulse which it receives was solicited by itself. Both the impulse given and that received, or the active expression and the passive externality, are consequently not an immediate but are mediated, and so each of the two forces is itself the determinateness which the other has over against it, is mediated by the other, and this mediating other is, again, its own determinative positing.</p>

The impulse by which it is solicited into activity is its own soliciting; the externality which affects it is not an immediate but is mediated by force itself; just as its own essential identity-with-self is not immediate but is mediated by its negation.

What is present is only an empty, transparent distinction, an illusory being, but this illusory being is the mediation which is the independent subsistence itself. Not only are they opposite determinations which sublate themselves within themselves, nor is their movement merely a transition; but partly the immediacy from which the beginning and the transition into otherness was made is itself only a posited immediacy, and partly, in consequence of this, each of the determinations is in its immediacy already the unity with its other, so that the transition is just as much the spontaneously posited return-into-self.</p>

That is to say, since this form unity contains its two determinations as opposites, their identity is only this transition, and therein only the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>of both, not their identity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pregnant with content.&nbsp;</em>Or, this holding fast to form is in general the side of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness.&nbsp;</em>What is posited in accordance with this is not the real totality of the whole, but the totality or the fact itself only in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>of form; since this unity is the mere conjunction of opposite determinations, then, when one of them is taken first-and it does not matter which-we must say of the substrate or fact that it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for that reason&nbsp;</em>equally essentially in the other determinateness, but also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only&nbsp;</em>in the other, just as we said before that it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only&nbsp;</em>in the first.</p>

In the relation of inner and outer, the essential moment of this emerges namely, that its determinations are posited as being in negative unity in such a manner that each immediately is not only it other but also the totality of the whole. But in the Notion as such this totality is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal-a&nbsp;</em>substrate which is not yet present in the relation of inner and outer. In the negative identity of inner and outer which is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate conversion&nbsp;</em>of one of these determinations into the other, there is also lacking that substrate which above was called the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fact.</em></p>

The totality as substrate and content is this immediacy, which is reflected into itself, only through the presupposing reflection of form which sublates their difference and posits itself as indifferent identity, as a reflected unity, over against it. Or, the content is the form itself in so far as this determines itself as difference, making itself into one of its sides as externality, but into the other as an immediacy that is reflected into itself, or into inner.</p>

This transition of each into the other is their immediate identity as substrate; but it is also their mediated identity; for it is precisely through its other that each is what it is in itself, the totality of the relation. Or, conversely, the determinateness of each side, because it is in itself the totality, is mediated with the other determinateness; thus the totality mediates itself with itself through the form or determinateness, and the determinateness is mediated with itself through its simple identity.</p>

Now because in the absolute, the form is only simple self-identity, the absolute does not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determine&nbsp;</em>itself; for determination is a form difference which, in the first instance, counts as such. But because at the same time it contains all difference and form-determination whatever, or because it is itself the absolute form and reflection,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the difference of the content&nbsp;</em>must also appear in it. But the absolute itself is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute identity;&nbsp;</em>this is its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determination,&nbsp;</em>for in it all manifoldness of the world-in-itself and the world of Appearance, or of inner and outer totality, is sublated. In the absolute itself is no&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming,&nbsp;</em>for it is not being; not is it a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-reflecting&nbsp;</em>determining, for it is not essence which determines itself only inwardly; nor is it an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">uttering or expressing of itself</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sich &auml;ussern</em>], for it is the identity of inner and outer. But the movement of reflection thus stands over&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">against&nbsp;</em>the absolute identity of the absolute. In this identity it is sublated and thus is only the inner of it; but as inner, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external</em>&nbsp;to it. At first, therefore, this movement consists only in sublating its act in the absolute. It is the beyond of the manifold differences and determinations and their movement, a beyond which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">lies at the back of the absolute;&nbsp;</em>consequently, though it accepts them, it also destroys them; it is thus the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative exposition&nbsp;</em>of the absolute previously mentioned. In its true presentation this exposition is the preceding whole of the logical movement of the sphere of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being and essence,</em>the content of which has not been raked together from outside as something given and contingent, or submerged in the abyss of the absolute by a reflection alien to that content; on the contrary, it has determined itself internally through its inner necessity, and as being&#39;s own&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming&nbsp;</em>and as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reflection&nbsp;</em>of essence, has withdrawn into the absolute as into its ground.</p>

Secondly, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation,&nbsp;</em>and this as negation is formal reflection-into-self. These two sides constitute, in the first instance, the two&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">extremes&nbsp;</em>of the attribute, the mean of which is the attribute itself, since it is both the absolute and the determinateness. The second of these extremes is the negative as negative, the reflection which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is external&nbsp;</em>to the absolute. Or, in so far as it is taken as the inner of the absolute and it is its own determination to posit itself as mode, then it is the self-externality of the absolute, the loss of itself in the mutability and contingency of being, the accomplished transition of itself into opposites&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">without the return into itself</em>; the multiplicity of form and content determinations lacking the character of totality.</p>

But first, in doing so its relationship to these determinations is not merely negative, but this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its act is the reflective movement itsey,&nbsp;</em>and it is only as this that the absolute is truly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute identity.&nbsp;</em>Secondly, in this activity the exposition is not dealing merely with something external, nor is mode merely the uttermost externality, but because it is illusory being as illusory being it is the return-into-self, the self-dissolving reflection and it is as this that the absolute is absolute being. Thirdly, the expounding reflection seems to begin from its own determinations and from something external, and to take up the modes and also the determinations of the attribute as simply found outside the absolute; and its act seems to consist in merely tracing these back into an indifferent identity. But in fact it has in the absolute itself the determinateness from which it begins. For the absolute as first indifferent identity is itself only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the determinate absolute&nbsp;</em>or attribute, because it is the unmoved, still unreflected absolute. This<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness,&nbsp;</em>because it is determinateness, belongs to the reflective movement; through this alone is it determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the first identity,&nbsp;</em>and equally through this alone does it have absolute form and is not that which merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is</em>&nbsp;equal to itself, but is that which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posits</em>itself as equal to itself.</p>

Spinozism is a defective philosophy because in it reflection and its manifold determining is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external thinking. The</em>substance of this system is one substance, one indivisible totality; there is no determinateness that is not contained and dissolved in this absolute; and it is sufficiently important that in this necessary notion, everything which to natural picture thinking or to the understanding with its fixed distinctions, appears and is vaguely present as something self-subsistent, is completely reduced to a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mere positedness. Determinateness is negation-is&nbsp;</em>the absolute principle of Spinoza&#39;s philosophy; this true and simple insight establishes the absolute unity of substance. But Spinoza stops short at&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation as determinateness&nbsp;</em>or quality; he does not advance to a cognition of negation as absolute, that is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-negating, negation; thus his substance does not itself contain the absolute form,</em>&nbsp;and cognition of it is not an immanent cognition. True, substance is the absolute unity of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thought&nbsp;</em>and being or extension; therefore it contains thought itself, but only in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>with extension, that is, not as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">separating&nbsp;</em>itself from extension, hence in general not as a determinative and formative activity, nor as a movement which returns into and begins from itself. Two consequences follow from this: one is that substance lacks the principle of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">personality</em>&nbsp;&mdash; a defect which has been the main cause of hostility to Spinoza&#39;s system; the other is that cognition is external reflection which does not comprehend and derive from substance that which appears as finite, the determinateness of the attribute and the mode, and generally itself as well, but is active as an external understanding, taking up the determinations as given&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">and tracing them back&nbsp;</em>to the absolute but not taking its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beginnings&nbsp;</em>from the latter.</p>

Apart from the fact that intellect, in accordance with its nature, is postulated as posterior to attribute &mdash; for Spinoza defines it as mode &mdash; attribute, determination as determination of the absolute, is thus made&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dependent on an other,&nbsp;</em>namely, intellect, which appears as external and immediate over against substance.</p>

These two attributes are therefore adopted&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">empirically.&nbsp;</em>Thought and being represent the absolute in a determination; the absolute itself is their absolute unity and they themselves are only unessential forms; the order of things is the same as that of figurate conceptions or thoughts, and the one absolute is contemplated only by external reflection, by a mode, under these two determinations, once as a totality of conceptions, and again as a totality of things and their mutations. just as it is this external reflection which makes that distinction, so too does it lead the difference back into absolute identity and therein submerges it. But this entire movement proceeds outside the absolute. True, the absolute is itself also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thought,&nbsp;</em>and so far this movement is only in the absolute; but as remarked, it is in the absolute only as unity with extension, and therefore not as this movement which is essentially also the moment of opposition. Spinoza makes the sublime demand of thought that it consider everything under the form of eternity,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sub specie aeterni,</em>that is, as it is in the absolute. But in the said absolute, which is only unmoved identity, the attribute, like the mode,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>only as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">vanishing,</em>&nbsp;not as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming,&nbsp;</em>so that here, too, the vanishing takes its positive beginning only from without.</p>

Further, this mode remains mere mode; on the one hand it is something immediately given, and on the other, its nullity is not cognised as reflection-into-self. Consequently, the Spinozistic exposition of the absolute is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">complete&nbsp;</em>in so far as it starts from the absolute, then follows with the attribute, and ends with the mode; but these three are only enumerated&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one after the</em>&nbsp;other, without any inner sequence of development, and the third is not negation as negation, not the negatively self-related negation which would be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own self&nbsp;</em>the return into the first identity, so that this identity would then be veritable identity. Hence the necessity of the advance of the absolute to unessentiality is lacking and also the dissolution of the unessentiality in and for itself in the identity; or, there is lacking the becoming both of identity and of its determinations.</p>

The one-sidedness of a philosophical principle is usually countered by its opposite one-sidedness and totality, as in all of them, is usually present as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dispersed completeness-The&nbsp;</em>monad is only one, a negative reflected into itself; it is the totality of the content of the world. In it, the varied multiplicity has not only vanished but is in a negative manner<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">preserved;&nbsp;</em>(Spinoza&#39;s substance is the unity of all content; but this manifold content of the world&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>not as such in it, but in the reflection which is external to it). The monad is therefore essentially&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ideative;&nbsp;</em>but although it is finite its nature is not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">passive,&nbsp;</em>the mutations and determinations in it being manifestations within it of itself. It is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">entelechy,&nbsp;</em>and the manifestation is its own act. The monad is thereby also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate, distinguished from others;&nbsp;</em>the determinateness falls in the particular content and the way and manner of the manifestation. Consequently, the monad is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>or according to its substance, the totality,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">but it is not so in its manifestation. This limitation&nbsp;</em>of the monad necessarily falls, not in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-positing or ideating&nbsp;</em>monad, but in its in-itself [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Ansichsein</em>]; or it is absolute limit, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">predestination</em>&nbsp;which s posited by another being than itself. Further, since limited entities exist only as related to other limited entities, yet the monad is at the same time a self-enclosed absolute, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">harmony&nbsp;</em>of these limitations, that is, the relation of the monads to one another, falls outside them and is likewise pre-established by another being or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself.</em></p>

Further, it is necessary to let finitude consist in this, that the content or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substance is distinct from the form</em>, and also that the former is limited but the latter infinite. But now we should have to find in the concept of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute monad&nbsp;</em>not only that absolute unity of form and content, but also the nature of reflection as the self-relating negativity which repels itself from itself whereby it posits and creates. True, in Leibniz&#39;s system, the further point is likewise to be found that God is the source of existence and of the essence of the monads, that is to say, that those absolute limitations in the being-in-self or the in-itself of the monads are not limitations in and for themselves, but vanish in the absolute. But in these determinations are to be seen only the usual conceptions which are not philosophically developed, nor raised into speculative Notions. Thus the principle of individuation does not receive its profounder realisation; the concepts concerning the distinction between the various finite monads and their relation to their absolute do not originate out of this being itself, or not in an absolute manner, but are the product of ratiocinative, dogmatic reflection and therefore have not achieved an inner coherence.</p>

But this &#39;way and manner&#39; is the determination of the absolute itself, namely, its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">initial identity or its merely implicit unity.&nbsp;</em>And through this reflection, too, not only is that initial in-itself posited as essenceless determination but, since the reflection is negative self-relation, it is through this alone that the in-itself becomes this mode. This reflection, as sublating itself in its determinations and in general as the self-returning movement, is first truly absolute identity and at the same time is the determining of the absolute or its modality. The mode is therefore the externality of the absolute, but equally only as the reflection of the absolute into itself; or it is the absolute&#39;s&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">own manifestation,&nbsp;</em>so that this manifestation is its reflection-into-self and therefore its being-in-and-for-itself.</p>

This, as possible, is an in-itself, which is at the same time a sublated in-itself or an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">otherness.&nbsp;</em>Because, therefore, it is only a possible content,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another&nbsp;</em>and its opposite is equally&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">possible. A is A;&nbsp;</em>equally, -A&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>-A. These two statements each express the possibility of its content determination. But as these identical statements they are mutually indifferent; it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not posited&nbsp;</em>in the one that the other too is added to it. Possibility is the comparing relation of both; in its determination as a reflection of the totality, possibility implies that the opposite too is possible. It is therefore the relating ground, that because&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">A = A, therefore&nbsp;</em>also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">-A = -A;&nbsp;</em>in the possible A the possible not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">-A&nbsp;</em>is also contained and it is this very relation which determines both as possible.</p>

But secondly, because it is manifold within itself and has manifold connections with an other, and because variety in its own self passes over into opposition, it is contradictory. If a possibility is in question and its contradiction is to be demonstrated, one need only fasten on to the multiplicity which it contains as content or as its conditioned Existence, and from this its contradiction is easily discovered. But this is not a contradiction arising from comparison; on the contrary, manifold Existence is in its own self this, to sublate itself and to fall to the ground, and for this reason essentially contains within itself the determination of being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">merely a possible.&nbsp;</em>When all the conditions of something are completely present, it enters into actuality; the completeness of the conditions is the totality as in the content, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the something itself&nbsp;</em>is this content determined as being equally actual as possible. In the sphere of conditioned ground, the conditions have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside them&nbsp;</em>the form &mdash; that is, the ground or the reflection which is for itself &mdash; which connects them into moments of the something in question and which produces Existence&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in them.</em>Here, on the other hand, immediate actuality is not determined by a presupposing reflection to be condition, but it is posited that this actuality itself is possibility.</p>

And since, conversely, its moment of in-itself is thereby at the same time sublated, it becomes actuality, that is, that moment which it likewise already is. Thus what vanishes is this, that actuality was determined as the possibility or in-itself of an other, and conversely, possibility as an actuality which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not that&nbsp;</em>whose possibility it is.</p>

Rain, for example, is the cause of wetness which is its effect; the rain wets &mdash; this is an analytic proposition; the same water which is rain is wetness; as rain, this water is only in the form of a fact by itself; as wetness or moisture, on the other hand, it is adjectival, something posited, that is no longer supposed to have its subsistence in its own self; and the one determination like the other, is external to it. Thus the cause of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this colour&nbsp;</em>is a colouring agent, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pigment,&nbsp;</em>which is one and the same actuality, once in the form of an agent external to it, that is, externally connected with an agent different from it, and again in the determination, equally external to it, of an effect. The cause of an<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">act&nbsp;</em>is the inner disposition in an active subject, and this is the same content and worth as the outer existence which it acquires through the deed. If the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">motion&nbsp;</em>of a body is considered as effect, then its cause is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">propulsive&nbsp;</em>force; but it is the same quantum of motion that is present before and after the impulse, the same existence which the propelling body contained and communicated to the propelled body; and the quantum it communicates is the same as that which it loses itself.</p>

Only this further content is a contingent accessory which does not concern the cause; what other qualities the painter possesses, apart from his being the painter of this picture, this does not enter into this painting; only those of his properties represented in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">effect</em>are present in him&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as cause;&nbsp;</em>he is not cause as regards the rest of his properties. And so, whether the propulsive body is stone or wood, green, yellow, and so on, this does not enter into the impulse it communicates; in this respect it is not cause.</p>

The change of form suffered by the basic fact in this passage through a number of intermediate terms conceals the identity which it retains in that passage. In this multiplication of causes which have entered between that fact and the ultimate effect, the former is at the same time connected with other things and circumstances, so that the complete effect is contained, not in that first term which was pronounced to be the cause, but only in these several causes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">together.&nbsp;</em>If, for example, a man developed his talent in circumstances arising from the loss of his father who was hit by a bullet in battle, then this shot (or still further back, the war or a cause of the war, and so on to infinity) could be assigned as the cause of the man&#39;s skill. But it is clear that the shot, for example, is not by itself this cause, but only the combination of it with other effective determinations. Or rather, it is not cause at all but only a single&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moment&nbsp;</em>which belonged to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">circumstances of the possibility.</em></p>

Thus it is inadmissible to say that food is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">cause&nbsp;</em>of blood, or certain dishes or chill and damp are the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">causes&nbsp;</em>of fever, and so on; it is equally inadmissible to assign the ionic climate as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">cause of</em>&nbsp;Homer&#39;s works, or Caesar&#39;s ambition as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">cause&nbsp;</em>of the downfall of the republican constitution of Rome. In history generally, spiritual masses and individuals are in play and reciprocal determination with one another; but it is rather the nature of spirit, in a much higher sense than it is the character of the living thing in general, not to receive into itself another&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">original&nbsp;</em>entity, or not to let a cause continue itself into it but to break it off and to transmute it. However, these relationships belong to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Idea&nbsp;</em>where they will first come up for consideration.</p>

For this reason, that the cause is a finite, a determinate in general; determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one</em>&nbsp;moment of form over against the effect, it has its determinateness or negation outside it; but for this very reason it is itself&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finite,</em>&nbsp;has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its determinateness within it&nbsp;</em>and this is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positedness or effect.&nbsp;</em>This its identity is also posited, but it is a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">third term,&nbsp;</em>the immediate substrate; causality is therefore external to itself, because here its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">originativeness&nbsp;</em>is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediacy.&nbsp;</em>The form difference is, therefore, a primary&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness,&nbsp;</em>not yet determinateness&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited as</em>&nbsp;determinateness, it is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simply affirmative otherness.&nbsp;</em>Finite reflection, on the one hand, stops short at this immediate, removes the form unity from it and makes it in one respect cause and in another respect effect; on the other hand, it transfers the form unity into the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite,&nbsp;</em>and through the endless progress expresses its impotence to attain and hold fast this unity.</p>

For these earlier parts I could claim the indulgence of fair-minded critics on account of the scant preliminary studies in this field which could have afforded me a support, material, and a guiding thread. In the case of the present part, I may claim their indulgence rather for the opposite reason; for the logic of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion,&nbsp;</em>a completely ready-made and solidified, one may say, ossified material is already to hand, and the problem is to render this material fluid and to re-kindle the spontaneity of the Notion in such dead matter. If the building of a new city in a waste land is attended with difficulties, yet there is no shortage of materials; but the abundance of materials presents all the more obstacles of another kind when the task is to remodel an ancient city, solidly built, and maintained in continuous possession and occupation. Among other things one must resolve to make no use at all of much material that has hitherto been highly esteemed.&nbsp;</p>

For what subject matter can cognition have that is more sublime than&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">truth&nbsp;</em>itself! Yet the doubt whether it is not just this subject matter that requires an excuse may occur to us if we recall the sense in which Pilate put the question,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">What is truth?&nbsp;</em>In the words of the poet: &#39;With the courtier&#39;s mien that purblind yet smiling condemns the cause of the earnest soul.&#39; Pilate&#39;s question bears the meaning &mdash; which may be regarded as an element in good manners &mdash; together with a reminder of it, that the aim of attaining truth is, as everyone knows, something given up and long since set aside, and that the unattainableness of truth is recognised even among professional philosophers and logicians. But if the question that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">religion&nbsp;</em>raises as to the value of things, insights, and actions &mdash; a question which in its import has a like meaning &mdash; is once more vindicating its claims in our days, then philosophy must surely hope that it will no longer be thought so strange if it, too, in its immediate domain once more asserts its true aim, and, after having lapsed into the manner and method of other sciences and their renunciation of the claim to truth, strives to rise again to that aim. In respect of this attempt, it is not, strictly speaking, permissible to offer any apology; but in respect of the execution, I may plead in excuse that my official duties and other personal circumstances allowed me but scattered hours of labour at a science that demands and deserves undistracted and undivided exertion.</p>

Now although it is true that the Notion is to be regarded, not merely as a subjective presupposition but as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute foundation</em>, yet it can be so only in so far as it has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">made</em>&nbsp;itself the foundation. Abstract immediacy is no doubt a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first</em>; yet in so far as it is abstract it is, on the contrary mediated, and therefore if it is to be grasped in its truth its foundation must first be sought. Hence this foundation, though indeed an immediate, must have made itself immediate through the sublation of mediation.</p>

Similarly, with regard to the active substance, (a) the action is the translation of the cause into the effect, into the other of the cause, into positedness, and (b) the cause reveals itself in the effect as what it is; the effect is identical with the cause, is not an other-; thus the cause in acting reveals the posited being as that which the cause essentially is. Each side, therefore, in both its identical and negative relation to the other becomes the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposite</em>&nbsp;of itself, so that the other, and therefore also each, remains&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identical with itself</em>. But the identical and the negative relations are both one and the same; substance is self-identical only in its opposite and this constitutes the absolute identity of the substances posited as a duality. Active substance, through the act of positing itself as the opposite of itself, an act which is at the same time the sublating of its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposed otherness</em>, of passive substance, is manifested as cause or originative substantiality. Conversely, through being acted on, posited being is manifested as posited, the negative as negative, and therefore passive substance as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-related</em>&nbsp;negativity, the cause meeting in this other simply and solely with its own self. Through this positing, then, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposed</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicit</em>&nbsp;originativeness becomes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">explicit</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for itself</em>; yet this being that is in and for itself is such only in so far as this positing is equally a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sublating</em>&nbsp;of what was presupposed; in other words absolute substance has returned to itself and so become absolute, only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">out of</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in</em>&nbsp;its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positedness</em>. Hence this reciprocity is the appearance that again sublates itself, the revelation that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">illusory being</em>&nbsp;of causality in which the cause appears&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as</em>&nbsp;cause,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is illusory being</em>. This infinite reflection-into-self, namely, that being is in and for itself only in so far as it is posited, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consummation of substance</em>. But this consummation is no longer&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substance</em>itself but something higher, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion</em>, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subject</em>. The transition of the relation of substantiality takes place through its own immanent necessity and is nothing more than the manifestation of itself, that the Notion is its truth, and that freedom is the truth of necessity.</p>

I also indicated there the defect of that system alike as to form and to matter. But the refutation of the system is another matter. With respect to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">refutation</em>&nbsp;of a philosophical system I have elsewhere also made the general observation that&nbsp;<a name="HL3_580a"></a>one must get rid of the erroneous idea of regarding the system as out and out&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">false</em>, as if the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">true</em>&nbsp;system by contrast were only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposed</em>&nbsp;to the false. The context itself in which Spinoza&#39;s system here finds mention provides the true standpoint of the system and the question whether it is true or false. The relation of substance resulted from the nature of essence; this relation and its exposition as a developed totality in a system is, therefore, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessary standpoint</em>&nbsp;assumed by the absolute. Such a standpoint, therefore, is not to be regarded as an opinion, a subjective, arbitrary way of thinking of an individual, as an aberration of speculation; on the contrary, speculative thinking in the course of its progress finds itself necessarily occupying that standpoint and to that extent the system is perfectly true; but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">it is not the highest standpoint</em>. Yet this does not mean that the system can be regarded as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">false</em>, as requiring and being capable of refutation; on the contrary, the only thing about it to be considered false is its claim to be the highest standpoint. Consequently, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">true</em>&nbsp;system cannot have the relation to it of being merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposed</em>&nbsp;to it; for if this were so, the system, as this opposite, would itself be one-sided. On the contrary, the true system as the higher, must contain the subordinate system within itself.</p>

The system need only refuse to recognise those assumptions; the defect is a defect only for him who starts from the requirements and demands based on those assumptions.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">Thus it has been said that for anyone who does not presuppose as an established fact the freedom and self-subsistence of the self-conscious subject there cannot be any refutation of Spinozism. Besides, a standpoint so lofty and so intrinsically rich as the relation of substance, far from ignoring those assumptions even contains them: one of the attributes of Spinoza&#39;s substance is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thinking.&nbsp;</em>On the contrary, Spinozism knows how to resolve and assimilate the determinations in which these assumptions conflict with it, so that they appear&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in the system, but</em>&nbsp;in the modifications appropriate to it. The nerve, therefore, of the external refutation consists solely in clinging stubbornly to the antitheses of these assumptions, for example, to the absolute self-subsistence of the thinking individual as against the form of thought posited in absolute substance as identical with extension. The genuine refutation must penetrate the opponent&#39;s stronghold and meet him on his own ground; no advantage is gained by attacking him somewhere else and defeating him where he is not. The only possible refutation of Spinozism must therefore consist, in the first place, in recognising its standpoint as essential and necessary and then going on to raise that standpoint to the higher one through its own immanent dialectic. The relationship of substance considered simply and solely in its own intrinsic nature leads on to its opposite, to the Notion. The exposition of substance (contained in the last book) which leads on to the Notion is, therefore, the sole and genuine refutation of Spinozism. It is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unveiling</em>of substance, and this is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">genesis of the Notion,&nbsp;</em>the chief moments of which have been brought together above. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>of substance is its relation of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessity;&nbsp;</em>but this unity is only an inner necessity; in positing itself through the moment of absolute negativity it becomes a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">manifested or posited identity, and</em>&nbsp;thereby the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">freedom&nbsp;</em>which is the identity of the Notion. The Notion, the totality resulting from the reciprocal relation, is the unity of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">two substances&nbsp;</em>standing in that relation; but in this unity they are now free, for they no longer possess their identity as something blind, that is to say, as something merely inner; on the contrary, the substances now have essentially the status of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">illusory being,&nbsp;</em>of being moments of reflection, whereby each is no less immediately united with its other or its positedness and each&nbsp;<a name="HL3_582"></a>contains its positedness&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within itself,&nbsp;</em>and consequently in its other is posited as simply and solely identical with itself.</p>

The mutual opacity of the substances standing in the causal relationship has vanished and become a self-transparent clarity, for the originality of their self-subsistence has passed into a positedness; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">original&nbsp;</em>substance is original in that it is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the cause of itself,&nbsp;</em>and this is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substance raised to the freedom of the Notion.</em></p>

Because being that is in and for itself is immediately&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a positedness,&nbsp;</em>the Notion in its simple self-relation is an absolute&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>which, however, as purely self-related is no less immediately a simple identity. But this self-relation of the determinateness as the union of itself with itself is equally the negation of the determinateness, and the Notion as this equality with itself is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal.&nbsp;</em>But this identity has equally the determination of negativity; it is the negation or determinateness which is self-related; thus the Notion is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individual.&nbsp;</em>Each of them, the universal and the individual, is the totality, each contains within itself the determination of the other and therefore these totalities are one and one only, just as this unity is the differentiation of itself into the free&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">illusion&nbsp;</em>of this duality &mdash; of a duality which, in the difference of the individual and the universal, appears as a complete opposition, yet an opposition which is so entirely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">illusory&nbsp;</em>that in thinking and enunciating the one, the other also is immediately thought and enunciated.</p>

It may seem to differ from what is elsewhere understood by &#39;notion&#39; and in that case we might be asked to indicate how that which we have here found to be the Notion is contained in other conceptions or explanations. On the one hand, however, there can be no question of a confirmation based on the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">authority&nbsp;</em>of the ordinary understanding of the term; in the science of the Notion its content and character can be guaranteed solely by the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immanent deduction</em>which contains its genesis and which already lies behind us. On the other hand, the Notion as here deduced must,&nbsp;<a name="HL3_583"></a>of course, be recognisable in principle in what is elsewhere presented as the concept of the Notion. But it is not so easy to discover what others have said about the nature of the Notion. For in the main they do not concern themselves at all with the question, presupposing that everyone who uses the word automatically knows what it means. Latterly, one could have felt all the more relieved from any need to trouble about the Notion since, just as it was the fashion for a while to say everything bad about the imagination, and then the memory, so in philosophy it became the habit some time ago, a habit which in some measure still exists, to heap every kind of slander on the Notion, on what is supreme in thought, while the incomprehensible and non-comprehension are, on the contrary, regarded as the pinnacle of science and morality. I will confine myself here to a remark which may help one to grasp the notions here developed and may make it easier to find one&rsquo;s bearings in them. The Notion, when it has developed into a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete existence&nbsp;</em>that is itself free, is none other than the I or pure self-consciousness. True,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">I have&nbsp;</em>notions, that is to say, determinate notions; but the I is the pure Notion itself which, as Notion, has come into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existence.&nbsp;</em>When, therefore, reference is made to the fundamental determinations which constitute the nature of the I, we may presuppose that the reference is to something familiar, that is, a commonplace of our ordinary thinking. But the I is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first,</em>this pure self-related unity, and it is so not immediately but only as making abstraction from all determinateness and content and withdrawing into the freedom of unrestricted equality with itself. As such it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality;&nbsp;</em>a unity that is unity with itself only through its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative&nbsp;</em>attitude, which appears as a process of abstraction, and that consequently contains all determinedness dissolved in it.<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Secondly</em>, the I as self-related negativity is no less immediately&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individuality&nbsp;</em>or is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolutely determined,</em>&nbsp;opposing itself to all that is other and excluding it &mdash;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individual personality.&nbsp;</em>This absolute&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality&nbsp;</em>which is also immediately an absolute&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individualisation,</em>and an absolutely determined being, which is a pure positedness and is this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolutely determined&nbsp;</em>being it only through its unity with the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positedness,&nbsp;</em>this constitutes the nature of the I &mdash; as well as of the Notion; neither the one nor the other can be truly comprehended unless the two indicated moments are grasped at the same time both in their abstraction and also in their perfect unity.</p>

It is one of the profoundest and truest insights to be found in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Critique of Pure Reason</em>&nbsp;that the unity which constitutes the nature of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion</em>is recognised as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">original synthetic</em>&nbsp;unity of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">apperception</em>, as unity of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">I think</em>, or of self-consciousness. This proposition constitutes the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transcendental</em>&nbsp;deduction of the categories; but this has always been regarded as one of the most difficult parts of the Kantian philosophy, doubtless for no other reason than that it demands that we should go beyond the mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">representation</em>&nbsp;of the relation in which the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">I</em>&nbsp;stands to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">understanding</em>, or notions stand to a thing and its properties and accidents, and advance to the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thought</em>&nbsp;of that relation.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">An object</em>, says Kant, is that in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">notion</em>&nbsp;of which the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">manifold</em>&nbsp;of a given intuition is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unified</em>. But all unifying of representations demands a u<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nity of consciousness</em>&nbsp;in the synthesis of them. Consequently it is this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity of consciousness</em>&nbsp;which alone constitutes the connection of the representations with the object and therewith their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objective validity</em>&nbsp;and on which rests even the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">possibility of the understanding</em>. Kant distinguishes this unity from the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subjective unity</em>&nbsp;of consciousness, the unity of representation whereby I am conscious of a manifold as either&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simultaneous</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">successive</em>, this being dependent on empirical conditions.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_584a"></a>On the other hand, the principles of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objective</em>&nbsp;determination of notions are, he says, to be derived solely from the principle of the&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);"><em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transcendental unity of apperception</em></span>. Through the categories which are these objective determinations, the manifold of given representations is so determined as to be brought into the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity of consciousness</em>.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_584b"></a>According to this exposition, the unity of the notion is that whereby something is not a mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mode of feeling</em>, an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intuition</em>, or even a mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">representation</em>, but is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">object</em>, and this objective unity is the unity of the ego with itself.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_585"></a>In point of fact, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comprehension</em>&nbsp;of an object consists in nothing else than that the ego makes it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its own</em>, pervades it and brings it into<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&nbsp;its own form</em>, that is, into the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality</em>&nbsp;that is immediately a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness</em>, or a determinateness that is immediately universality. As intuited or even in ordinary conception, the object is still something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alien</em>. When it is comprehended, the being-in-and-for-self which it possesses in intuition and pictorial thought is transformed into a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positedness</em>; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">I</em>&nbsp;in<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thinking</em>&nbsp;it pervades it.&nbsp;</p>

Life, or organic nature, is the stage of nature at which the Notion emerges</span>, but as blind, as unaware of itself and unthinking; the Notion that is self-conscious and thinks pertains solely to spirit. But the logical form of the Notion is independent of its non-spiritual, and also of its spiritual, shapes. The necessary premonition on this point has already been given in the Introduction. It is a point that must not wait to be established within<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">logic</em>&nbsp;itself but must be cleared up&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">before</em>&nbsp;that science is begun.&nbsp;</p>

The conception of this relation both in&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">ordinary psychology and in the Kantian transcendental philosophy</span>&nbsp;is that the empirical&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">material</em>, the manifold of intuition and representation, first&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exists on its own account</em>, and that then the understanding&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">approaches</em>&nbsp;it, brings&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity</em>&nbsp;into it and by abstraction raises it to the form of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality</em>. The understanding is in this way an intrinsically empty&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form</em>&nbsp;which, on the one hand, obtains a reality through the said&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">given</em>&nbsp;content and, on the other hand,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstracts</em>from that content, that is to say,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">lets it drop</em>&nbsp;as something useless, but useless only for the Notion. In both these actions the Notion is not the independent factor, not the essential and true element of the prior given material; on the contrary, it is the material that is regarded as the absolute reality, which cannot be extracted from the Notion.</p>

For the reality which the Notion gives itself must not be received by it as something external but must, in accordance with the requirement of the science, be derived from the Notion itself. But the truth is that it is not the material given by intuition and representation that ought to be vindicated as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">real</em>&nbsp;in contrast to the Notion.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_587a"></a><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">People often say, &#39;It is only a notion,&#39; contrasting the notion not only with the Idea but with sensuous, spatial and temporal, palpable reality as something more excellent than the Notion; and then the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract</em>&nbsp;is held to be of less account than the concrete because it lacks so much of this kind of material. In this view, to abstract means to select from the concrete object for&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">our subjective purposes this or that mark</em>&nbsp;without thereby detracting from the worth and status of the many other properties and features left out of account; on the contrary, these as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">real</em>&nbsp;retain their validity completely unimpaired, only they are left yonder, on the other side; thus it is only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inability</em>&nbsp;of the understanding to assimilate such wealth that compels it to content itself with the impoverished abstraction. Now to regard the given material of intuition and the manifold of representation as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">real</em>&nbsp;in contrast to what is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thought</em>, to the Notion, is a view, the abandonment of which is not only a condition of philosophising but is already presupposed by religion; for how can there be any need for religion, how can religion have any meaning, if the fleeting and superficial phenomena of the world of sensuous particulars are still regarded as the truth? But philosophy gives a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reasoned</em>&nbsp;insight into the true state of the case with regard to the reality of sensuous being; it assumes the stages of feeling and intuition as precedent to the understanding in so far as they are conditions of its genesis, but only in the sense that it is conditioned by their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reality</em>.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_588"></a>Abstract thinking, therefore, is not to be regarded as a mere setting aside of the sensuous material, the reality of which is not thereby impaired; rather is it the sublating and reduction of that material as mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">phenomenal appearance</em>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential</em>, which is manifested only in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion</em>.</span>&nbsp;</p>

Kant has introduced this consideration by the extremely important thought that there are synthetic judgements&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a priori.&nbsp;</em>This original synthesis of apperception is one of the most profound principles for speculative development; it contains the beginning of a true apprehension of the nature of the Notion and is completely opposed to that empty identity or abstract universality which is not within itself a synthesis. The further development, however, does not fulfil the promise of the beginning. The very expression&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">synthesis easily</em>&nbsp;recalls the conception of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>unity and a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mere combination</em>&nbsp;of entities that are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intrinsically separate.&nbsp;</em>Then, again, the Kantian philosophy has not got beyond the psychological reflex of the Notion and has reverted once more to the assertion that the Notion is permanently conditioned by a manifold of intuition. It has declared intellectual cognition and experience to be a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">phenomenal</em>&nbsp;content, not because the categories themselves are only finite but, on the ground of a psychological idealism, because they are merely determinations originating in self-consciousness. It is in keeping with this standpoint, too, that the Notion without the manifold of intuition is again declared to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">empty and devoid of content&nbsp;</em>despite the fact that it is a synthesis&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a priori;&nbsp;</em>as such, it surely does contain determinateness and difference within itself. Moreover, since the determinateness is that of the Notion and therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute determinateness, individuality,&nbsp;</em>the Notion is the ground and source of all finite determinateness and manifoldness.</p>

In reason, the highest stage of thought, one ought to have expected the Notion to lose the conditionedness in which it still appears at the stage of understanding and to attain to perfect truth. But this expectation is disappointed. For Kant defines the relation of reason to the categories as merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dialectical</em>&nbsp;and, indeed, takes the result of this dialectic to be the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite nothing&nbsp;</em>&mdash; just that and nothing more.</p>

We have already quoted from the Kantian deduction of the categories that according to it the object, as that in which the manifold of intuition is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unified</em>, is this unity solely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">through the unity of self-consciousness</em>.

In the same way, it is also commonly admitted that when thinking appropriates a given object, this thereby suffers an alteration and is changed from something sensuous to something thought; and yet that not only is the essential nature of the object not affected by this alteration but that it is only in its Notion that it is in its truth, whereas in the immediacy in which it is given it is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">appearance</em>&nbsp;and a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contingency</em>; that the cognition that truly comprehends the object is the cognition of it as it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in and for itself</em>, and that the Notion is its very objectivity.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_590e"></a></p>

On this point we have already remarked that, on the contrary, it is precisely in the Notion that this manifoldness, in so far as it pertains to intuition in contrast to the Notion, is sublated and that through the Notion the object is reduced to its non-contingent essential nature. The latter enters into the sphere of Appearance and for that very reason the Appearance is not devoid of essential being, but is a manifestation of essence.

Regarded from this aspect, the Notion has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subjugated</em>&nbsp;being and essence, which from other starting points include also feeling and intuition and representation, and which appeared as its antecedent conditions, and has proved itself to be their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unconditioned ground</em>. There now remains the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">second</em>&nbsp;aspect, to the treatment of which this Third Book of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Logic</em>&nbsp;is devoted, namely the exposition of how the Notion builds up in and from itself the reality that has vanished in it. It has therefore been freely admitted that the cognition that stops short at the Notion purely as such, is still incomplete and has only as yet arrived at&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract truth</em>. But its incompleteness does not lie in its lack of that presumptive reality given in feeling and intuition but rather in the fact that the Notion has not yet given itself a reality of its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">own</em>, a reality produced from its own resources. The demonstrated absoluteness of the Notion relatively to the material of experience and, more exactly, to the categories and concepts of reflection, consists in this, that this material as it appears&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">apart from</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">prior</em>&nbsp;to the Notion has no&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">truth</em>; this it has solely in its ideality or its identity with the Notion. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">derivation</em>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">real</em>&nbsp;from it if we want to call it derivation, consists in the first place essentially in this, that the Notion in its formal abstraction reveals itself as incomplete and through its own immanent dialectic passes over into reality; but it does not fall back again onto a ready-made reality confronting it and take refuge in something which has shown itself to be the unessential element of Appearance because, having looked around for something better, it has failed to find it; on the contrary, it produces the reality from its own resources.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_592"></a><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">It will always stand out as a marvel how the Kantian philosophy recognised the relation of thought to sensuous reality, beyond which it did not advance, as only a relative relation of mere Appearance, and perfectly well recognised and enunciated a higher unity of both in the Idea in general and, for example, in the Idea of an intuitive understanding, and yet stopped short at this relative relation and the assertion that the Notion is and remains utterly separate from reality thus asserting as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">truth&nbsp;</em>what it declared to be finite cognition, and denouncing as an unjustified extravagance and a figment of thought what it recognised as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">truth</em>&nbsp;and of which it established the specific notion.</span></p>

As contrasted with these concrete sciences (although these have and retain as their inner formative principle that same logical element, or the Notion, which had served is their archetype), logic is of course a formal science; but it is the science of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute form</em>&nbsp;which is within itself a totality and contains the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pure Idea of truth itself</em>. This absolute form has in its own self its content or reality; the Notion, not being a trivial, empty identity, possesses in its moment of negativity or of absolute determining, the differentiated determinations; the content is simply and solely these determinations of the absolute form and nothing else a content posited by the absolute form itself and consequently also adequate to it.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_592c1"></a>For this reason, this form is of quite another nature than logical form is ordinarily taken to be. It is already&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">on its own account truth</em>, since this content is adequate to its form, or the reality to its Notion; and it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pure truth</em>&nbsp;because the determinations of the content do not yet have the form of an absolute otherness or of absolute immediacy.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_592c"></a>When Kant, in connection with logic comes to discuss the old and famous question:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">what is truth?</em>&nbsp;he first of all&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presents</em>&nbsp;to the reader as a triviality the explanation of the term as the&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">agreement of cognition with its object</span>&nbsp;a definition of great, indeed of supreme, value.

If Kant had considered the Idea of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intuitive understanding</em>&nbsp;in the light of the above definition of truth, he would have treated that Idea which expresses the required agreement, not as a figment of thought but rather as the truth.</p>

But first of all it is to be observed that it usually happens with such formal ratiocination that it forgets in its discourse the very point on which it has based its argument and of which it is speaking. It is alleged that it would be absurd to ask for the criterion of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">truth of the content</em>&nbsp;of cognition; but according to the definition it is not the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content</em>&nbsp;that constitutes the truth, but the agreement of the content with the Notion. A content such as is here spoken of,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">without the Notion</em>, is something notionless, and hence without essential being; certainly we cannot ask for the criterion of the truth of such a content, but for the very opposite reason; not, that is, because the content, as something notionless, is not the required agreement, but simply because it cannot be anything more than a mere truthless opinion.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_594"></a>Let us leave on one side the content which causes the confusion here the confusion into which formalism falls whenever it sets out to explain something and which makes it say the opposite of what it intends and let us stop at the abstract view that logic is only formal and, in fact, abstracts from all content; we then have a one-sided cognition which is not to contain any object, an empty, blank form which therefore is no more an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">agreement</em>&nbsp;for an&nbsp;<a name="HL3_594a"></a><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">agreement essentially requires&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">two</em>&nbsp;terms</span>&nbsp;then it is truth.

The laws of logic by themselves (not counting the heterogeneous accretions of applied logic and the rest of the psychological and anthropological material) are commonly restricted, apart from the law of contradiction, to some meagre propositions concerning the conversion of judgements and the forms of syllogisms. Even here the forms which come up for treatment as well as their further modifications are only, as it were, historically taken up; they are not subjected to criticism to determine whether they are in and for themselves&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">true</em>. Thus, for example, the form of the positive judgement is accepted as something perfectly correct in itself, the question whether such a judgement is true depending solely on the content. Whether this form is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own self</em>&nbsp;a form of truth, whether the proposition it enunciates, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individual</em>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal</em>, is not inherently dialectical, is a question that no one thinks of investigating.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_595"></a>It is straightway assumed that this judgement is, on its own account, capable of containing truth and that the proposition enunciated by any positive judgement is true, although it is directly evident that it lacks what is required by the definition of truth, namely, the agreement of the Notion and its object; if the predicate, which here is the universal, is taken as the Notion, and the subject, which is the individual, is taken as the object, then the one does not agree with the other. But if the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract</em>&nbsp;universal which is the predicate falls short of constituting a Notion, for a Notion certainly implies something more, and if, too, a subject of this kind is not yet much more than a grammatical one, how should the judgement possibly contain truth seeing that either its Notion and object do not agree, or it lacks both Notion and object? On the contrary, then, what is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">impossible</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absurd</em>&nbsp;is to attempt to grasp the truth in such forms as the positive judgement and the judgement generally. Just as the Kantian philosophy did not consider the categories in and for themselves but declared them to be finite determinations incapable of containing truth, on the wrong ground that they are subjective forms of self-consciousness, still less did that philosophy subject to criticism the forms of the Notion which are the content of ordinary logic; on the contrary, it has adopted a portion of them, namely, the functions of judgement, for the determination of the categories and accepted them as valid presuppositions.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_595a"></a><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">Even if we are to see in logical forms nothing more than formal functions of thought, they would for that very reason be worthy of investigation to ascertain how far, on their own account, they correspond to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">truth</em>. A logic that does not perform this task can at most claim the value of a descriptive natural history of the phenomena of thinking just as they occur. It is an infinite merit of Aristotle, one that must fill us with the highest admiration for the powers of that genius, that he was the first to undertake this description. It is necessary however to go further</span>&nbsp;and to ascertain both the systematic connection of these forms and their value.&nbsp;</p>

But this becoming has the significance of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-repulsion,&nbsp;</em>so that it is rather the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outcome&nbsp;</em>which is the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unconditioned and original. Being,&nbsp;</em>in its transition into essence, has become an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">illusory being&nbsp;</em>or a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positedness, and becoming or</em>transition into an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>has become a positing; and conversely, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positing&nbsp;</em>or reflection of essence has sublated itself and has restored itself as a being that is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not posited,&nbsp;</em>that is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">original.&nbsp;</em>The Notion is the interfusion of these moments, namely, qualitative and original being is such only as a positing, only as a return-into-self, and this pure reflection-into-self is a sheer&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming-other or determinateness</em>&nbsp;which, consequently, is no less an infinite, self-relating&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness.</em></p>

But this double negation is conceived of as though it were&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>to the abstraction, as though not only were the other omitted properties of the concrete distinct from the one retained, which is the content of the abstract universal, but also as though this operation of omitting the other properties and retaining the one were a process outside the properties themselves. To such an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality</em>in face of that movement, the universal has not yet determined itself; it is still within itself that absolute mediation which is, precisely, the negation of the negation or absolute negativity.</p>

However, we cannot speak of the universal apart from determinateness which to be more precise is particularity and individuality, for the universal, in its absolute negativity, contains determinateness in and for itself. The determinateness, therefore, is not introduced from outside when we speak of it in connection with the universal. As negativity in general or in accordance with the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first, immediate&nbsp;</em>negation, the universal contains determinateness generally as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">particularity;&nbsp;</em>as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">second&nbsp;</em>negation, that is, as negation of the negation, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute determinateness or individuality and concreteness.&nbsp;</em>The universal is thus the totality of the Notion; it is a concrete, and far from being empty, it has through its Notion a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content,&nbsp;</em>and a content in which it not only maintains itself but one which is its own and immanent in it. We can, indeed, abstract from the content: but in that case we do not obtain the universal of the Notion but only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract</em>&nbsp;universal, which is an isolated, imperfect moment of the Notion and has no truth.</p>

In so far as it contains determinateness, it is not merely the first negation, but also the reflection of this negation into itself. Taken expressly with this first negation, it is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">particular,&nbsp;</em>and it is as such that we are soon to consider it; but in this determinateness it is essentially still a universal; this side we have here still to consider. For determinateness, being in the Notion, is the total reflection, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">two-fold illusory being&nbsp;</em>which on the one hand has an illusory reference<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outwards</em>, the reflection-into-other, and on the other hand has an illusory reference&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inwards</em>, the reflection-into-self. The former reflection involves distinction from an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other</em>; from this standpoint, the universal possesses a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">particularity&nbsp;</em>which has its resolution in a higher universal. Now even though it is merely a relative universal, it does not lose its character of universal; it preserves itself in its determinateness, not merely as though in its connection with the determinateness it remained indifferent to it &mdash; for then it would be merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">compounded</em>&nbsp;with it but so that it is what we have just called the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">illusory reference inwards</em>. The determinateness, as determinate&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion</em>, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">bent back into itself</em>&nbsp;out of the externality; it is the Notion&#39;s&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">own immanent character</em>, which is an essential character by virtue of the fact that, in being taken up into the universality and pervaded by it, it equally pervades the universality, being of like compass and identical with it; it is the character that belongs to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">genus&nbsp;</em>as the determinateness that is not separated from the universal. Accordingly, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limitation</em>&nbsp;is not outward-going but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positive</em>, for the Notion, through its universality, stands in free relation to itself. Thus even the determinate Notion remains within itself infinitely free Notion.</p>

The latter, in its turn, can also be grasped as genus but as a more abstract one; but it always pertains only to that side of the determinate Notion which has a reference outwards. The truly higher universal is that in which this outward-going side is taken back into the universal, the second negation, in which the determinateness is present simply&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as&nbsp;</em>posited or<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as&nbsp;</em>illusory being. Life, ego, spirit, absolute Notion, are not universals merely in the sense of higher genera, but are concretes whose determinatenesses, too, are not species or lower genera but genera which, in their reality, are absolutely self-contained and self-fulfilled. In so far as life, ego, finite spirit are, as they certainly are, also only determinate Notions, their absolute resolution is in that universal which as truly absolute Notion is to be grasped as the Idea of infinite spirit, whose&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>being is infinite, transparent reality wherein it contemplates its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">creation,&nbsp;</em>and in this creation its own self.</p>

The true meaning and resolution of these determinations is just this, that they attain to their Notion, their truth; being, determinate being, something, or whole and parts, etc. substance and accidents, cause and effect, are by themselves [merely] thought-determinations; but they are grasped as determinate&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notions&nbsp;</em>when each is cognized in unity with its other or opposite determination. Whole and parts, cause and effect, for example, are not as yet different terms determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">particulars&nbsp;</em>relatively to each other, because although&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in themselves</em>they constitute&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one&nbsp;</em>Notion, their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>has not yet reached the form of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality;&nbsp;</em>thus the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference,&nbsp;</em>too, which is in these relationships, has not as yet the form of being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one&nbsp;</em>determinateness.

Nature, because it is the self-externality of the Notion, is free to indulge itself in this variety, just as spirit, too, even though it possesses the Notion in the shape of the Notion, engages in pictorial thinking and runs riot in its endless variety. The manifold natural genera or species must not be esteemed as anything more than the capricious fancies of spirit in its representations. Both indeed show traces and inklings of the Notion on all sides, but do not present a faithful copy of it because they are the side of its free self-externality. The Notion is absolute power just because it can freely abandon its difference to the shape of self-subsistent diversity, outer necessity, contingency, caprice, opinion, which however must not be taken for more than the abstract aspect of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nothingness.</em></p>

The Universality becomes form in so far as the difference is present as the essential moment, just as, on the contrary, in the purely universal it is present only as absolute negativity,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not</em>&nbsp;as difference which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited</em>&nbsp;as such.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/james-clr/works/dialecti/james6.htm#J602" style="color: rgb(51, 0, 80); background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong>&copy;</strong></a></p>

But the enunciation of what it is, itself sublates what it is supposed to be; it is enunciated as one with determinateness, and in this way, out of the abstraction is established its truth and the Notion. But every determinate Notion is, of course,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">empty&nbsp;</em>in so far as it does not contain the totality, but only a one-sided determinateness. Even when it has some other concrete content, for example man, the state, animal, etc., it still remains an empty Notion, since its determinateness is not the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">principle&nbsp;</em>of its differences; a principle contains the beginning and the essential nature of its development and realization; any other determinateness of the notion, however, is sterile. To reproach the Notion generally with being empty, is to misjudge that absolute determinateness of the Notion which is the difference of the Notion and the only true content in the element of the Notion.</p>

This fixity consists in the form of abstract Universality which has just been considered: through it they become&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immutable</em>.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_610a"></a>For qualitative determinateness, and also determinations of reflection, are essentially&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limited</em>, and, through their limitation, have a relation to their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other</em>; hence the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessity</em>&nbsp;of transition and passing away.

Their content is at variance with the form, because it is not determinateness itself as universal; that is, it is not totality of the Notion&#39;s difference, or not itself the whole form; but the form of the limited understanding is itself the imperfect form, namely,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract</em>&nbsp;universality. But further, we must recognise the infinite force of the understanding in splitting the concrete into abstract determinatenesses and plumbing the depth of difference, the force that at the same time is alone the power that effects their transition.</p>

The mutability that it exhibits in intuition already points to the universal; yet all that it brings to view is merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another,&nbsp;</em>equally mutable, material; therefore, only the same thing again, not the universal which should appear and take its place.

On the contrary, it is on account of that element that the material of such sciences is of an inferior nature; the intuition of figures or numbers does not procure a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">scientific&nbsp;</em>knowledge of them; only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thinking&nbsp;</em>about them can do this. But if by intuition we are to understand not merely the element of sense but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objective totality,</em>then it is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intellectual&nbsp;</em>intuition; that is to say, intuition has for its object not the external side of existence, but what existence holds of imperishable reality and truth-reality, only in so far as it is essentially in the Notion and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determined&nbsp;</em>by it, the Idea, whose more precise nature has to reveal itself at a later stage. The advantage which intuition as such is supposed to have over the Notion is external reality, the Notionless element, which first receives a value through the Notion.</p>

Difference, which is an essential moment of the Notion though not yet posited as such in the pure universal, receives its due in the determinate Notion. Determinateness in the form of universality is linked with the universal to form a simple determination; this determinate universal is the self-related determinateness; it is the determinate determinateness or absolute negativity posited&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for itself.&nbsp;</em>But the self-related determinateness is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individuality.&nbsp;</em>Just as universality is immediately in and for itself already particularity, so too particularity is immediately in and for itself also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individuality;&nbsp;</em>this individuality is, in the first instance, to be regarded as the third moment of the Notion, in so far as we hold on to its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposition&nbsp;</em>to the two other moments, but it is also to be considered as the absolute return of the Notion into itself, and at the same time as the posited loss of itself.</p>

We have already shown that number is an unsuitable form in which to hold Notional determinations; but for the determinations of the Notion itself it is unsuitable in the highest degree; number, since it has the unit [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">das Eins</em>] for its principle, converts them as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">counted&nbsp;</em>into completely isolated and mutually indifferent determinations. We have seen from the foregoing that the truth is that the different determinate Notions, far from falling apart into number, are simply only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one&nbsp;</em>and the same Notion.</p>

We are at once struck by the inconsequential way in which the species of notions are introduced:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">there are,&nbsp;</em>in respect of quantity, quality, etc., the following notions.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">There are,&nbsp;</em>expresses no other justification than that we&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">find&nbsp;</em>such species&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">already to hand&nbsp;</em>and they present themselves<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">empirically.&nbsp;</em>In this way, we obtain an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">empirical&nbsp;</em>logic &ndash; an odd science this, an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">irrational&nbsp;</em>cognition of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">rational.&nbsp;</em>In proceeding thus, logic sets a very bad example of obedience to its own precepts; it permits itself for its own purpose to do the opposite of what it prescribes as a rule, namely that notions should be deduced, and scientific propositions (therefore also the proposition: there are such and such species of notions) should be proved. In this matter, the Kantian philosophy commits a further inconsequence: it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">borrows&nbsp;</em>the categories, as so-called root notions, for the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">transcendental&nbsp;</em>logic, from the subjective logic in which they were adopted empirically. Since it admits the latter fact, it is hard to see why transcendental logic resolves to borrow from such a science instead of directly resorting to experience.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">To cite some details of this, notions are mainly classified according to their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">clearness,&nbsp;</em>into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">clear&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">obscure, distinct&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indistinct, adequate&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inadequate. To&nbsp;</em>these we can also add&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">complete, profuse</em>, [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&uuml;berfliessend</em>] notions and suchlike superfluities. As regards the classification by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">clearness,&nbsp;</em>it is readily seen that this standpoint and its related distinctions are taken from psychological, not from logical, determinations. The so-called clear notion is supposed to suffice for distinguishing one object from another; but this is not yet a notion, it is nothing more than a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subjective representation</em>. What an obscure notion is must be left to itself, for otherwise it would not be an obscure but a distinct notion. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">distinct&nbsp;</em>notion is supposed to be one whose&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">marks&nbsp;</em>can be indicated. As such it is, strictly speaking, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>notion. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mark,&nbsp;</em>if it is taken in its correct meaning, is none other than the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>or the simple<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content&nbsp;</em>of the notion, in so far as it is distinguished from the form of universality. But the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mark,&nbsp;</em>in the first instance, does not have quite this preciser meaning but is in general merely a determination whereby a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">third&nbsp;</em>something takes note of an object, or the notion; it can therefore be a very contingent circumstance. In general it expresses not so much the immanence and essential nature of the determination as its relation to an understanding&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>to it. If this is really an understanding, it has the notion before it and distinguishes this only and solely by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">what is in the notion.&nbsp;</em>But if the mark is supposed to be distinct from the notion, then it is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sign</em>or some other determination which belongs to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">representation&nbsp;</em>of the thing, not to its notion. What the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indistinct&nbsp;</em>notion may be, can be passed over as superfluous.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">If the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mark&nbsp;</em>of the distinct notion were really supposed to be the determination of the notion itself, logic would find itself in difficulty over the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple&nbsp;</em>notions which, according to another classification, are opposed to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">compound.&nbsp;</em>For if a true, that is an immanent, mark of the simple notion were to be indicated, we should not be regarding it as simple; but in so far as no mark was given, it would not be a distinct notion. But here, now, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">clear&nbsp;</em>notion helps out, Unity, reality, and suchlike determinations are supposed to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple&nbsp;</em>notions, probably only because logicians were unable to discover their specific nature and contented themselves with having merely a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">clear</em>notion of them, that is, no notion at all.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Definition,&nbsp;</em>that is, the statement of the notion, in general demands the statement of the genus and the specific difference. Therefore it presents the notion, not as something simple, but in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">two&nbsp;</em>countable&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">components.&nbsp;</em>Yet surely no one will for that reason suppose such notion to be a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">compound.&nbsp;</em>The simple notion seems to suggest&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract simplicity,&nbsp;</em>a unity which does not contain within itself difference and determinateness and which therefore, too, is not the unity that belongs to the Notion. In so far as an object is present in ordinary thinking, especially in memory, or even as an abstract thought determination, it can be quite simple. Even the object that is richest in content, such as, for example, spirit, nature, the world, even God, when uncomprehendingly taken up into the simple representation of the equally simple expression: spirit, nature, the world, God, is doubtless something simple at which consciousness can stop short without going on to pick out its peculiar determination or its mark. But the objects of consciousness should not remain simple, should not remain such representations or abstract thought determinations; on the contrary, they should be<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comprehended,&nbsp;</em>that is to say, their simplicity should be determined with their inner difference. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">compound&nbsp;</em>notion, however, is a contradiction in terms. We can, of course, have a notion of something composite; but a compound notion would be something worse than&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">materialism,&nbsp;</em>which assumes only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substance&nbsp;</em>of the soul to be composite, yet none the less takes&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thought&nbsp;</em>to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple.</em>Uneducated reflection first stumbles on the idea of composition, because it is the completely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>relation, the worst form in which anything can be considered; even the lowest natures must be an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inner&nbsp;</em>unity. That the form of the untruest existence should be assigned, above all, to the ego, to the Notion, that is something we should not have expected and that can only be described as inept and barbarous.</p>

Just as in the text-books of logic &ndash; to a greater or lesser degree, according to the whim of the author &ndash; it is related that there are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">affirmative, negative, identical, conditional, necessary&nbsp;</em>notions, and so on. As the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nature of the Notion itself&nbsp;</em>has progressed beyond all such determinations and therefore these, if adduced in connexion with the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion,&nbsp;</em>occur out of their proper place, they only admit of superficial definitions and appear at this stage devoid of all interest. At the basis of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contrary&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contradictory</em>notions &ndash; a distinction to which particular attention is paid here &ndash; lies the reflective determination of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">diversity&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposition.&nbsp;</em>They are regarded as two particular&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">species,&nbsp;</em>that is, each as firmly fixed on its own account and indifferent to the other, without any thought of the dialectic and the inner nullity of these differences &ndash; as though what is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contrary&nbsp;</em>must not equally be determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contradictory.</em>The nature and the essential transition of the forms of reflection which they express have been considered in their proper place. In the Notion, identity has developed into universality, difference into particularity, opposition, which withdraws into the ground, into individuality. In these forms, those categories of reflection are present as they are in their Notion. The universal has proved itself to be not only the identical, but at the same time the different or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contrary&nbsp;</em>as against the particular and individual, and in addition, also to be opposed to them or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contradictory;&nbsp;</em>in this opposition, however, it is identical with them and is their true ground in which they are sublated. The same holds good of particularity and individuality which are likewise the totality of the determinations of reflection.</p>

Only it is customary to regard them likewise as completely rigid relationships and from this point of view to put forward a number of sterile propositions about them. The most prolix discussion on this point concerns again the relation of contrariety and contradiction to subordination and co-ordination. Since&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the judgment is the relation of determinate Notions,&nbsp;</em>it is only at that stage that the true relationship will come to view. That fashion of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comparing&nbsp;</em>these determinations without a thought for their dialectic or for the progressive alteration of their determination, or rather for the conjunction of opposed determinations present in them, makes the whole consideration of what is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concordant&nbsp;</em>or not concordant in them &ndash; as though the concord or discord were something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">separate&nbsp;</em>and<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">permanent</em>&nbsp;&ndash; into something merely sterile and meaningless.</p>

The determinations of the Notion, universality, particularity and individuality, are certainly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">diverse,&nbsp;</em>as are lines, or the letters of algebra; further, they are also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposed,&nbsp;</em>and to this extent would also admit of the signs plus and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">minus.&nbsp;</em>But they themselves, and above all their relations &ndash; even if one stops at&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsumption&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inherence &ndash;&nbsp;</em>are in their essential nature entirely different from letters and lines and their relationships, the equality or difference of magnitude, the plus and<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">minus,&nbsp;</em>or a superimposition of lines, or their joining to form angles and the dispositions of spaces enclosed by them. It is characteristic of such objects that, in contrast to determinations of the Notion, they are mutually&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external,&nbsp;</em>and have a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fixed&nbsp;</em>character. Now when Notions are so taken that they correspond to such signs, they cease to be Notions. Their determinations are not inert entities like numbers and lines whose relation does not itself belong to them; they are living movements; the distinguished determinateness of the one side is immediately internal to the other side too. What would be a complete contradiction in the case of numbers and lines is essential to the nature of the Notion. Higher mathematics, which also goes on to the infinite and allows itself contradictions, can no longer employ its usual signs for representing such determinations. To denote the conception &ndash; which is still very far from being a Notion &ndash; of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite approximation&nbsp;</em>of two ordinates, or in equating a curve with an infinite number of infinitesimal straight lines, all it does is to draw two straight lines&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">apart from each other&nbsp;</em>and to make the straight lines approach the curve but remain&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">distinct&nbsp;</em>from it; for the infinite, which is here the point of interest, it refers us to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pictorial thinking.</em></p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">What has misled logicians into this attempt is primarily the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative&nbsp;</em>relationship in which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality, particularity&nbsp;</em>and<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individuality&nbsp;</em>are supposed to stand to one another; the universal means,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more extensive&nbsp;</em>than the particular and the individual, and the particular means,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more extensive&nbsp;</em>than the individual. The Notion is the most concrete and richest determination because it is the ground and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">totality&nbsp;</em>of the preceding determinations, of the categories of being and of the determinations of reflection; these, therefore, are certainly also present in it. But its nature is completely misunderstood when they are retained in it in their former abstraction, when the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">wider extent of&nbsp;</em>the universal is taken to mean that it is something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more&nbsp;</em>or a greater&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantum&nbsp;</em>than the particular and the individual. As absolute ground, it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">possibility of quantity,&nbsp;</em>but equally so of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quality,&nbsp;</em>that is, its determinations are just as much qualitatively distinct; therefore they are taken in direct opposition to their truth when they are posited under the form of quantity alone. Thus, too, the determination of reflection is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">correlate&nbsp;</em>in which its opposite has an illusory being [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">scheint</em>]; it is not in an external relationship like a quantum. But the Notion is more than all this; its determinations are determinate&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notions,&nbsp;</em>are themselves essentially the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">totality&nbsp;</em>of all determinations. It is therefore quite inappropriate for the purpose of grasping such an inner totality, to seek to apply numerical and spatial relationships in which all determinations fall asunder; on the contrary, they are the last and worst medium which could be employed. Natural relationships such as magnetism, or colour relations, would be infinitely higher and truer symbols for the purpose. Since man has in language a means of designation peculiar to Reason, it is an idle fancy to search for a less perfect mode of representation to plague oneself with. It is essentially only spirit that can comprehend the Notion as Notion; for this is not merely the property of spirit but spirit&rsquo;s pure self. It is futile to seek to fix it by spatial figures and algebraic signs for the purpose of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outer eye</em>and an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">uncomprehending, mechanical mode of treatment&nbsp;</em>such as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">calculus.&nbsp;</em>In fact, anything else which might be supposed to serve as a symbol can at most, like symbols for the nature of God, evoke intimations and echoes of the Notion; if, however, one should seriously propose to employ them for expressing and cognizing the Notion, then the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external nature&nbsp;</em>of all symbols is inadequate to the task; the truth about the relationship is rather the converse, namely, that what in symbols is an echo of a higher determination, is only truly known through the Notion and can be approximated to the Notion only by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">separating&nbsp;</em>off the sensuous, unessential part that was meant to express it.</p>

The Notion&#39;s determinations, or what we have seen to be the same thing, the determinate Notions, have already been considered on their own; but this consideration was more a subjective reflection or subjective abstraction. But the Notion is itself this abstractive process, the opposing of its determinations is its own determining activity. The judgment is this positing of the determinate Notions by the Notion itself. Judging is thus&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">another&nbsp;</em>function than comprehension, or rather it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the other</em>&nbsp;function of the Notion as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determining&nbsp;</em>of the Notion by itself, and the further progress of the judgment into the diversity of judgments is the progressive determination of the Notion.

The determining itself is only totality in that it contains these totalities and their connection. This totality is the judgment. It contains, therefore, first, the two self-subsistents which are called subject and predicate. What each is cannot yet really be said; they are still indeterminate, for it is only through the judgment that they are to be determined. The judgment, being the Notion as determinate, the only distinction present is the general one that the judgment contains the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>Notion over against the still&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indeterminate&nbsp;</em>Notion. The subject can therefore, in the first instance, be taken in relation to the predicate as the individual over against the universal, or even as the particular over against the universal, or as the individual over against the particular; so far, they confront each other only in general, as the more determinate and the more universal.</p>

It is partly for this reason that the Notion determinations themselves could not be used for the two sides of the judgment; but a stronger reason is because the nature of the Notion determination is emphatically to be, not something abstract and fixed, but to have and to posit its opposite within it; since the sides of the judgment are themselves Notions and therefore the totality of its determinations, each side must run through all these determinations and exhibit them within itself, whether in abstract or concrete form. Now in order to fix the sides of the judgment in a general way when their determination is altered, those names are most serviceable which remain the same throughout the alteration. The name however stands over against the matter in hand or the Notion; this distinction presents itself in the judgment as such; now the subject is in general the determinate, and is therefore more that which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediately is,&nbsp;</em>whereas the predicate expresses the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal,</em>the essential nature or the Notion; therefore the subject as such is, in the first instance, only a kind of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">name; for what it is&nbsp;</em>is first enunciated by the predicate which contains&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>in the sense of the Notion. In the question: what&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>this? or: what kind of a plant&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is this? what&nbsp;</em>is often understood by the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>enquired after, is merely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">name,&nbsp;</em>and when this is learned one is satisfied and now knows what the thing&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is.&nbsp;</em>This is being in the sense of the subject. But the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion,&nbsp;</em>or at least the essence and the universal in general, is first given by the predicate, and it is this that is asked for in the sense of the judgment. Consequently, God, spirit, nature, or whatever it may be, is as the subject of a judgment at first only the name; what such a subject&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>as regards its Notion is first enunciated in the predicate. When enquiry is made as to the kind of predicate belonging to such subject, the act of judgment necessarily implies an underlying Notion. But this Notion is first enunciated by the predicate itself. Properly speaking, therefore, it is the mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">general idea</em>that constitutes the presupposed meaning of the subject and that leads to the naming of it; and in doing this it is contingent and a historical fact, what is, or is not, to be understood by a name. So many disputes about whether a predicate does or does not belong to a certain subject are therefore nothing more than verbal disputes, because they start from the form above mentioned; what lies at the base is so far nothing more than the name.</p>

The judgment has in general for its sides totalities which to begin with are essentially self-subsistent. The unity of the Notion is, therefore, at first only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of self-subsistents; not as yet the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete and pregnant&nbsp;</em>unity that has returned into itself from this reality, but only a unity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside&nbsp;</em>which the self-subsistent sides persist as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">extremes that are not sublated in it.&nbsp;</em>Now consideration of the judgment can begin from the original unity of the Notion, or from the self-subsistence of the extremes. The judgment is the self-diremption of the Notion;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this unity&nbsp;</em>is, therefore, the ground from which the consideration of the judgment in accordance with its true&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objectivity&nbsp;</em>begins. It is thus the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">original division&nbsp;</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Teilung</em>] of what is originally one; thus the word&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Urteil</em>&nbsp;refers to what judgment is in and for itself. But regarded from the side of externality, the Notion is present in the judgment as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Appearance,&nbsp;</em>since its moments therein attain self-subsistence, and it is on this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>side that ordinary thinking tends to fasten.</p>

From this standpoint, the act of judgment involves the reflection, whether this or that predicate which is in someone&#39;s head can and should be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">attached&nbsp;</em>to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">object&nbsp;</em>which exists on its own account&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside; the</em>&nbsp;very act of judging consists in this, that only through it is a predi<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">cate combined&nbsp;</em>with a subject, so that, if this combination did not take place, each on its own would still remain what it is, the latter an existent object, the former an idea in someone&#39;s head. The predicate which is attached to the subject should, however, also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">belong&nbsp;</em>to it, that is, be in and for itself identical with it. Through this significance of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">attachment, the subjective&nbsp;</em>meaning of judgment and the indifferent, outer subsistence of subject and predicate are sublated again: this action&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>good; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">copula&nbsp;</em>indicates that the predicate belongs to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>of the subject and is not merely externally combined with it. In the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">grammatical&nbsp;</em>sense, that subjective relationship in which one starts from the indifferent externality of the subject and predicate has its complete validity; for it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">words&nbsp;</em>that are here externally combined. We may take this opportunity of remarking, too, that though a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proposition&nbsp;</em>has a subject and predicate in the grammatical sense, this does not make&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">it a judgment.&nbsp;</em>The latter requires that the predicate be related to the subject as one Notion determination to another, and therefore as a universal to a particular or individual. If a statement about a particular subject only enunciates something individual, then this is a mere proposition, For example, &#39;Aristotle died at the age of 73, in the fourth year of the 115th Olympiad,&#39; is a mere proposition, not a judgment. It would partake of the nature of a judgment only if doubt had been thrown on one of the circumstances, the date of the death, or the age of that philosopher, and the given figures had been asserted on the strength of some reason or other. In that case, these figures would be taken as something universal, as time that still subsists apart from this particular content of the death of Aristotle, whether as time filled with some other content, or even as empty time. Similarly, the news that my friend N. has died is a proposition; and it would be a judgment only if there were a question whether he was really dead or only in a state of catalepsy.</p>

Above all, in this definition the essential feature of the judgment, namely, the difference of its determinations, is passed over; still less does it take into account the relationship of the judgment to the Notion.</p>

Since the judgment is the posited determinateness of the Notion, this determinateness possesses the said differences&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediately and abstractly as individuality and universality.&nbsp;</em>But in so far as the judgment is in general the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate being or otherness&nbsp;</em>of the Notion which has not yet restored itself to the unity whereby it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as Notion,&nbsp;</em>there emerges also-the determinateness which is notionless, the opposition of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being and reflection&nbsp;</em>or the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself.&nbsp;</em>But since the Notion constitutes the essential ground of the judgment, these determinations are at least indifferent to the extent that when one belongs to the subject and the other to the predicate, the converse relationship equally holds good. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subject&nbsp;</em>as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individual&nbsp;</em>appears, in the first instance, as that which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simply is or is for itself in&nbsp;</em>accordance with the specific determinateness of the individual &mdash; as an actual object, even though it be only an object in representational thought &mdash; as for example bravery, right, agreement, etc. &mdash; on which judgment is being made. The<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">predicate,&nbsp;</em>on the other hand, as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal,&nbsp;</em>appears as this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reflection&nbsp;</em>on the object, or rather as the object&#39;s reflection into itself, which goes beyond that immediacy and sublates the determinatenesses in their form of mere being; that is, it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">object&#39;s in-itself.&nbsp;</em>In this way, one starts from the individual as the first, the immediate, and it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">raised</em>&nbsp;by the judgment into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality,&nbsp;</em>just as, conversely, the universal that is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>descends in the individual into determinate being or becomes a being that is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for itself</em>.</p>

However, as sides of the judgment, which is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>determinate Notion, they have the determination of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moments&nbsp;</em>of the Notion, but by virtue of their immediacy, the determination is still quite&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple:&nbsp;</em>for it is not enriched by mediation, and also, in accordance with the abstract opposition, it is determined as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract individuality and universality.&nbsp;</em>The predicate, to speak of this first, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract&nbsp;</em>universal; since this abstract is conditioned by the mediation in which the individual or particular is sublated, this mediation is so far only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposition.&nbsp;</em>In the sphere of the Notion there can be no other&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediacy&nbsp;</em>than one in which mediation is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essentially and explicitly</em>&nbsp;a moment and which has come to be only through the sublating of that mediation, that is, the immediacy of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal.&nbsp;</em>Thus even&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative being,&nbsp;</em>too, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its Notion&nbsp;</em>a universal; but as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being,</em>&nbsp;the immediacy is not yet so&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited;&nbsp;</em>it is only as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality that</em>&nbsp;it is the Notion determination in which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>the fact that negativity essentially belongs to it. This relation is given in the judgment in which it is the predicate of a subject. Similarly, the subject is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract&nbsp;</em>individual, or the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>that is supposed to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as such,&nbsp;</em>and therefore the individual as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something&nbsp;</em>in general. Thus the subject constitutes the abstract side of the judgment according to which the Notion has in it passed over into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality.&nbsp;</em>As the two Notion determinations are determined, so also is their relation, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is or copula;&nbsp;</em>it too can only have the significance of an immediate, abstract&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being.&nbsp;</em>On account of the relation which as yet contains no mediation or negation, this judgment is called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the positive.</em></p>

With the negative judgment, how far it likewise comes under this expression, we shall deal presently. If no heed is given to the fact that in every judgment-at least, to begin with, every positive judgment, the assertion is made that the individual is a universal, this is partly because the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate form&nbsp;</em>whereby subject and predicate are distinguished is overlooked-the judgment being supposed to be nothing but the relation of two notions-and partly, probably, because the rest of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content&nbsp;</em>of the judgment,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Gaius is learned,</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the rose is red,&nbsp;</em>floats before the mind which is busy with the representation of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Gaius,&nbsp;</em>etc., and does not reflect on the form although such content at least as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">logical Gaius&nbsp;</em>who has usually to be dragged in as an example, is a much less interesting content and, indeed, is expressly chosen as uninteresting in order not to divert attention from the form to itself.</p>

The Notion itself is imperishable, but that which comes forth from it in its partition is subject to alteration and to return into its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal&nbsp;</em>nature. But conversely, the universal gives itself a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate being.&nbsp;</em>Just as essence issues into a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reflected being</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Schein</em>] in its determinations, ground into the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">manifestation of</em>&nbsp;Existence, and substance into the revelation of itself, into its accidents, so the universal<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">resolves&nbsp;</em>itself into the individual; and the judgment is this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">explication&nbsp;</em>of the universal, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">development</em>&nbsp;of the negativity which it already is in itself. The latter fact is enunciated by the converse proposition, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal is individual,</em>&nbsp;which is equally enunciated in the positive judgment. The subject, which in the first instance is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate individual, is</em>&nbsp;related in the judgment itself to its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other,</em>namely, the universal; consequently it is posited as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete;&nbsp;</em>in the sphere of being as a something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of many qualities,&nbsp;</em>or as the concrete of reflection,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a thing of manifold properties, an actuality of manifold possibilities, a substance&nbsp;</em>of such and such<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">accidents.&nbsp;</em>Since these manifold determinations here belong to the subject, the something or the thing, etc., is reflected into itself in its qualities, properties or accidents; or it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">continues&nbsp;</em>itself through them, maintaining itself in them and equally them in itself. The positedness or determinateness belongs to the being-in-and-for-self. The subject is, therefore, in its own self the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal.&nbsp;</em>The predicate, on the other hand, as this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality&nbsp;</em>which is not real or concrete but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract,&nbsp;</em>is, in contrast to the subject, the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>and contains only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one moment&nbsp;</em>of the subject&#39;s totality to the exclusion of the others. By virtue of this negativity which, as an extreme of the judgment, is at the same time self-related, the predicate is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract individual.&nbsp;</em>For example, in the proposition:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the rose is fragrant, the</em>&nbsp;predicate enunciates only one of the many properties of the rose; it singles out this particular one which, in the subject, is a concrescence with the others; just as in the dissolution of the thing, the manifold properties which inhere in it, in acquiring self-subsistence as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">matters, become individualised.&nbsp;</em>From this side, then, the proposition of the judgment runs thus:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the universal is individual</em></p>

But because the judgment is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of the two, and the subject is determined by the predicate as a universal, the subject is the universal.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Secondly,</em>the predicate is determined in the subject; for it is not a determination&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in general,&nbsp;</em>but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of the subject;&nbsp;</em>in the proposition:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the rose is fragrant,&nbsp;</em>this fragrance is not any indeterminate fragrance, but that of the rose; the predicate is therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an individual.&nbsp;</em>Now since subject and predicate stand in the relationship of the judgment, they have to remain mutually opposed as determinations of the Notion; just as in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reciprocity&nbsp;</em>of causality, before it attains its truth, the two sides have to retain their self-subsistence and mutual opposition in face of the sameness of their determination. When, therefore, the subject is determined as a universal, we must not take the predicate also in its determination of universality-else we should not have a judgment--but only in its determination of individuality; similarly, when the subject is determined as an individual, the predicate is to be taken as a universal.</p>

Of the two original propositions, one,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the universal is individual,&nbsp;</em>enunciates the judgment in respect of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its content,&nbsp;</em>which in the predicate is a singled out determination, while in the subject it is the totality of them; the other,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the individual is universal,&nbsp;</em>enunciates the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form&nbsp;</em>which is stated immediately by the proposition itself. In the immediate positive judgment the extremes are still simple: form and content are, therefore, still united. In other words, it does not consist of two propositions; the twofold relation which we found in it directly constitutes the one positive judgment. For its extremes appear as (a) self-subsistent, abstract sides of the judgment, and (b) each side is determined by the other, by virtue of the copula connecting them. But for that very reason, the difference of form and content&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is implicit&nbsp;</em>in it, as we have seen; to wit, what is implied in the first proposition:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the individual is universal,&nbsp;</em>pertains to the form, because it expresses the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate determinateness</em>of the judgment. On the other hand, the relationship expressed by the other proposition:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the universal is individual,&nbsp;</em>that is to say, that the subject is determined as universal, but the predicate as particular or individual concerns the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content;&nbsp;</em>for the sides of the judgment arise only through the reflection-into-self whereby the immediate determinatenesses are sublated, with the result that the form converts itself into an identity that has withdrawn into itself and persists in opposition to the distinction of form: that is, it converts itself into content.</p>

The form of the judgment is taken to be nothing more than the relation of two notions. But we have seen that these two notions do not have merely the relationless character of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum,&nbsp;</em>but are related to one another as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individual and universal.&nbsp;</em>These determinations constitute the truly logical&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content,</em>and, be it noted, constitute in this abstraction the content of the positive judgment; all&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other content</em>&nbsp;that appears in a judgment (the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sun is round, Cicero was a great orator in Rome,&nbsp;</em>it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">day now,&nbsp;</em>etc.) does not concern the judgment as such; the judgment merely enunciates that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subject is predicate,&nbsp;</em>or, more definitely, since these are only names, that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the individual is universal and vice versa.&nbsp;</em>By virtue of this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">purely logical content,&nbsp;</em>the positive judgment is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not true,&nbsp;</em>but has its truth in the negative judgment. All that is demanded of the content is that it shall not contradict itself in the judgment; but as has been shown it does contradict itself in the above judgment. It is, however, a matter of complete indifference if the above logical content is also called form, and by content is understood merely the remaining empirical filling; in that case, the form does not imply merely an empty identity, the determinate content lying outside it. The positive judgment has, then, through its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form&nbsp;</em>as positive judgment no truth; whoever gives the name of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">truth</em>&nbsp;to the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">correctness&nbsp;</em>of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intuition or perception,&nbsp;</em>or to the agreement of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">picture-thought&nbsp;</em>with the object, at any rate has no expression left for that which is the subject matter and aim of philosophy. We should at least have to call the latter the truth of reason; and it will surely be granted that judgments such as: Cicero was a great orator, and: it is day now, and so on, are not truths of reason. But they are not such not because they have, as it were contingently, an empirical content, but because they are merely positive judgments that can have and are supposed to have no other content than an immediate individual and an abstract determination.</p>

This determination is commonly treated in logic in connection with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contradictory&nbsp;</em>notions and it is inculcated as a matter of importance that in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative&nbsp;</em>of a notion one is to stick to the negative only and it is to be regarded as the merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indeterminate&nbsp;</em>extent of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>of the positive notion.

Thus the judgment runs: the individual is individual. From the other side, inasmuch as the subject was equally to be taken as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal</em>, and as the predicate (which in contrast to that determination of the subject is the individual)&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">widened&nbsp;</em>itself in the negative judgment&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">into particularity,&nbsp;</em>and as now, further, the negation of this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>is no less the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">purification&nbsp;</em>of the universality contained in the predicate, this judgment also runs: the universal is the universal.</p>

But the infinite judgment which is supposed to be its truth is, according to its negative expression,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negatively infinite,&nbsp;</em>a judgment in which even the form of judgment is set aside. But this is a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nonsensical judgment.&nbsp;</em>It is supposed to be a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">judgment,&nbsp;</em>and consequently to contain a relation of subject and predicate; yet&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">at the same time&nbsp;</em>such a relation is supposed not to be in it. Though the name of the infinite judgment usually appears in the ordinary logics, it is not altogether clear what its nature really is. Examples of negatively infinite judgments are easily obtained: determinations are negatively connected as subject and predicate, one of which not only does not include the determinateness of the other but does not even contain its universal sphere; thus for example spirit is not red, yellow, etc., is not acid, not alkaline, etc., the rose is not an elephant, the understanding is not a table, and the like. These judgments are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">correct or true,&nbsp;</em>as the expression goes, but in spite of such truth they are nonsensical and absurd. Or rather, they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not judgments at all.&nbsp;</em>A more realistic example of the infinite judgment is the evil action. In&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">civil litigation,&nbsp;</em>something is negated only as the property of the other party, it being conceded that it should be theirs if they had the right to it; and it is only the title of right that is in dispute; the universal sphere of right is therefore recognised and maintained in that negative judgment. But&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">crime&nbsp;</em>is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite judgment&nbsp;</em>which negates not merely the particular right, but the universal sphere as well, negates&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">right as right.&nbsp;</em>This infinite judgment does indeed possess&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">correctness,</em>&nbsp;since it is an actual deed, but it is nonsensical because it is related purely negatively to morality which constitutes its universal sphere.</p>

If examples are to be given of predicates of judgments of reflection, they must be of another kind than for judgments of existence. It is in the judgment of reflection that we first have, strictly speaking, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate content,&nbsp;</em>that is, a content as such; for the content is the form determination which is reflected into identity as distinct from the form in so far as this is a distinct determinateness &mdash; as it still is in the judgment. In the judgment of existence the content is merely an immediate, or abstract, indeterminate content. The following may therefore serve as examples of judgments of reflection: man is mortal, things are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">perishable,&nbsp;</em>this thing is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">useful, harmful; hardness, elasticity&nbsp;</em>of bodies,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">happiness,&nbsp;</em>etc. are predicates of this peculiar kind. They express an essential determination, but one which is in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relationship&nbsp;</em>or is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unifying&nbsp;</em>universality.</p>

To the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">some&nbsp;</em>is therefore added a more universal&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content</em>, say,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">men</em>, animals, etc. This is not merely an empirical content, but one determined by the form of the judgment; that is to say, it is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal</em>, because&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">some&nbsp;</em>contains universality and this must at the same time be separated from the individuals, since reflected individuality forms the basis.

Thus the subject that contains the individuals, their relation to particularity and the universal nature, is already posited as the totality of the determinations of the Notion. But this is really an external reflection. What is, in the first instance, already posited in the subject by its form, in respect of the mutual&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of these determinations, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">extension&nbsp;</em>of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&#39;this&#39;&nbsp;</em>to particularity; but this generalisation is not adequate to the &#39;this&#39;;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&#39;this&#39;&nbsp;</em>is something completely determined, but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&#39;some&#39;&nbsp;</em>is indeterminate. The extension must be appropriate to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&#39;this&#39;&nbsp;</em>and therefore, in conformity with it, be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">completely determined;&nbsp;</em>such an extension is totality, or, in the first instance,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality.</em></p>

This universality is, therefore, only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">taking together&nbsp;</em>of independently existing individuals; it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">community&nbsp;</em>of a property which only belongs to them in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comparison.&nbsp;</em>It is this community that is usually the first thing that occurs to subjective, unphilosophical thinking when universality is mentioned. It is given as the obvious reason why a determination is to be regarded as universal that it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">belongs to a number of things.&nbsp;</em>It is mainly this concept of universality, too, that<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">analysis&nbsp;</em>has in mind when, for example, it takes the development of a function in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">polynomial&nbsp;</em>to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more universal</em>&nbsp;than its development in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">binomial,&nbsp;</em>because the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">polynomial</em>&nbsp;presents&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more individual terms&nbsp;</em>than the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">binomial.&nbsp;</em>The demand that the function should be presented in its universality requires, strictly speaking,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a pantonomial,&nbsp;</em>the exhausted infinity; but here the limitation of this demand becomes apparent, and the representation of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite&nbsp;</em>number of terms has to content itself with its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ought,&nbsp;</em>and therefore also with a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">polynomial.&nbsp;</em>But in fact the binomial is already the pantonomial in those cases where the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">method or&nbsp;</em>rule affects only the dependence of one term on another, and the dependence of several terms on their predecessors does not particularise itself, but one and the same function remains the base. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">method or&nbsp;</em>rule is to be regarded as the genuine&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal;&nbsp;</em>in the progress of the development or in the development of a polynomial the rule is merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">repeated;&nbsp;</em>so that it gains nothing in universality through the increased number of the terms. We have already in an earlier chapter spoken of the spurious infinity and its illusory nature; the universality of the Notion is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reached beyond;&nbsp;</em>the spurious infinity remains afflicted with the beyond as an unattainable goal, for it remains the mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">progress</em>to infinity. When universality is pictured merely as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">allness</em>, a universality which is supposed to be exhausted in the individuals as individuals, then this is a relapse into that spurious infinity; or else mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plurality&nbsp;</em>is taken for allness. Plurality, however, no matter how great, remains unalterably mere plurality, and is not allness. But there is, here, a vague awareness of the true universality of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion;</em>it is the Notion that forces its way beyond the stubborn individuality to which unphilosophical thinking clings and beyond the externality of its reflection, substituting allness&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as totality,&nbsp;</em>or rather that being which is categorically in and for itself.</p>

Individuality, through this extension of itself to allness, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>as negativity, which is identical self-relation. It has not therefore remained that first individuality, that for example of Gaius, but is the determination that is identical with universality, or is the absolutely determined being of the universal. That first individuality of the individual judgment was not the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>one of the positive judgment, but came into being through the dialectical movement of the judgment of existence as such; it was already determined as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative identity&nbsp;</em>of the terms of that judgment. This is the true presupposition in the judgment of reflection; in contrast to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positing</em>&nbsp;which runs its course in that judgment, that first determinateness of individuality was the latter&#39;s&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself;&nbsp;</em>thus, what individuality is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself,&nbsp;</em>is now, through the movement of the judgment of reflection,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited,&nbsp;</em>namely, individuality as identical self-relation of the determinate.

Now the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">categorical judgment&nbsp;</em>has such a universality for its predicate, a predicate in which the subject possesses its im<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">manent&nbsp;</em>nature. But the categorical judgment is itself the first or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>judgment of necessity; accordingly the determinateness of the subject whereby it is a particular or individual over against the genus or species, so far belongs to the immediacy of external existence. But objective universality, too, has here as yet only its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>particularisation; hence it is on the one hand itself a determinate universality in contrast to which there are higher genera; on the other hand, it is not exactly the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proximate</em>&nbsp;genus, that is, its determinateness is not exactly the principle of the specific particularity of the subject. But what is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessary&nbsp;</em>in it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substantial identity&nbsp;</em>of the subject and predicate, contrasted with which that property of the subject which distinguishes it from the predicate is only an unessential positedness, or even merely a name; the subject is reflected in its predicate into its being-in-and-for-self. A predicate of this kind should not be classed with the predicates of the preceding judgments; to throw, for example, the judgments</p>

There are here two immediate Existences or external contingencies, of which in the categorical judgment there is at first only one, the subject; but since one is external to the other, this other is also external to the first. In accordance with this immediacy, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content&nbsp;</em>of the two sides is still mutually indifferent; hence this judgment is in the first instance a proposition of empty form. Now in the first place the immediacy is indeed as such a self-subsistent, concrete&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being;&nbsp;</em>but secondly, the relation of this being is the essential point; therefore this being is just as much a mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">possibility;&nbsp;</em>the hypothetical judgment involves, not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">that A is or that B is,&nbsp;</em>but only that if one is,<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">then&nbsp;</em>the other is; only the connection of the extremes is posited as being, not the extremes themselves.

This and the other relationships all come under the hypothetical judgment; but here they are no longer relationships of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistent sides,&nbsp;</em>but these sides are essentially only moments of one and the same identity. However, in the hypothetical judgment they are not yet opposed as Notion determinations, as individual or particular to universal, but at first only as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moments in general.&nbsp;</em>Thus the hypothetical judgment has rather the shape of a proposition; just as the particular judgment has an indeterminate content, so the hypothetical is indeterminate in form, since its content is not determined as a relationship of subject to predicate. Yet since the being is the being of an other, for that very reason it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself a unity of itself&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its other,&nbsp;</em>and consequently&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality;&nbsp;</em>at the same time it is, strictly speaking, only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">particular,&nbsp;</em>for it is a determinate and in its determinateness is not purely self-related.

What therefore is truly posited in this judgment is universality as the concrete identity of the Notion, whose determinations have no subsistence of their own but are only particularities posited in that identity.

In the hypothetical judgment, the Notion in its negative identity emerges in this externality. Through this identity, its moments receive the same determinateness, now posited in the disjunctive judgment, that they possess immediately in the hypothetical judgment. Hence the disjunctive judgment is objective universality posited at the same time in union with the form. It therefore contains first concrete universality or the genus&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in simple&nbsp;</em>form as the subject, and secondly the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">same&nbsp;</em>universality but as totality of its distinct determinations. A is either B&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">or C.</em>&nbsp;This is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessity of the Notion,&nbsp;</em>in which first the identity of the two extremes is one and the same extent, content and universality; secondly they are distinguished according to the form of the Notion-determinations, but in such a manner that, by reason of that identity, this distinction is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mere form</em>. Thirdly, the identical objective universality appears for that reason as the determination that is reflected into itself in contrast to the unessential form, that is, as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content,&nbsp;</em>but a content which possesses within itself the determinateness of form, once as the simple determinateness of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">genus,&nbsp;</em>and again, this same determinateness developed into its difference-in which way it is the particularity of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">species and</em>&nbsp;their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">totality,&nbsp;</em>the universality of the genus. The particularity in its development constitutes the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">predicate,&nbsp;</em>for it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more universal&nbsp;</em>in so far as it embraces the entire universal sphere of the subject, and this too in its detailed particularisation.</p>

Secondly, the species&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mutually exclude one another; A is either B or C;&nbsp;</em>for they are the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific difference&nbsp;</em>of the universal sphere. This&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">either-or&nbsp;</em>is their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative&nbsp;</em>relation. Yet in this they are just as identical as in their positive relation; the genus is their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity as determinate&nbsp;</em>particulars. If the genus were an abstract universality as in the judgments of existence, the species would also have to be taken as only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">diverse&nbsp;</em>and mutually indifferent; but it is not that external universality which results merely from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comparison and omission&nbsp;</em>but is the immanent and concrete universality of the species. An empirical disjunctive judgment lacks necessity; A is either B&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">or C&nbsp;</em>or D, etc., because the species&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">B, C&nbsp;</em>and D, etc., have&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">already been given;&nbsp;</em>strictly speaking, this cannot give us an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">either-or,&nbsp;</em>for species of this kind constitute, as it were, a merely subjective completeness; true, one species excludes the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other;&nbsp;</em>but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">either-or excludes every further&nbsp;</em>species and shuts off within itself a total sphere. This totality has its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessity&nbsp;</em>in the negative unity of the objective universal, which dissolves individuality within itself and possesses it as a simple&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">principle&nbsp;</em>of difference immanent in it by which the species are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determined and related.&nbsp;</em>Empirical species, on the contrary, have their differences in some contingency or other which is an external principle and therefore not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">their&nbsp;</em>principle, and consequently also not the immanent determinateness of the genus; for this reason they are also not related to one another according to their determinateness. But it is through the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation</em>&nbsp;of their determinateness that the species constitute the universality of the predicate. It is here really that the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contrary&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contradictory&nbsp;</em>notions should first find their place; for in the disjunctive judgment is posited the essential difference of the Notion; but in it they at the same time also possess their truth, namely, that the contrary and contradictory themselves are each distinguished as contrary and contradictory. Species are contrary in so far as they are merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">diverse,</em>that is to say in so far as they possess through the genus as their objective nature an existence that is in and for itself; they are<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contradictory&nbsp;</em>in so far as they exclude one another. But each of these determinations by itself is onesided and lacks truth; in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">either-or&nbsp;</em>of the disjunctive judgment their unity is posited as their truth, in accordance with which the species&#39; self-subsistent existence as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete universality&nbsp;</em>is itself also the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">principle&nbsp;</em>of the negative unity whereby they mutually exclude one another.</p>

This expression indicates in the first place, a mere quantitative difference of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">more</em>&nbsp;or less-determinations possessed by a universal in relation to a particularity coming under it. From this point of view, it remains contingent what is properly the proximate genus. In so far, however, as the genus is taken as a universal formed merely by the omission of determinations, it cannot really form a disjunctive judgment; for it is contingent whether it has retained the determinateness which constitutes the principle of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">either-or; the</em>&nbsp;genus would not be exhibited at all in the species according to its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness,&nbsp;</em>and the species could only possess a contingent completeness. In the categorical judgment, the genus is at first only in this abstract form over against the subject, and therefore not necessarily the proximate genus to it and is so far external. But when the genus is a concrete, essentially&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>universality, then it is, as a simple determinateness, the unity of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moments of the Notion,&nbsp;</em>which in this simplicity are only sublated, but have their real difference in the species. Accordingly, a genus is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proximate&nbsp;</em>genus of a species in so far as the latter has its specific difference in the essential determinateness of the genus, and the species as a whole are differentiated by a principle that lies in the nature of the genus.</p>

It is this negative unity in general that separates subject and predicate, but now it is itself posited as differentiated-in the subject as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple&nbsp;</em>determinateness, in the predicate as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">totality.&nbsp;</em>This separation of subject and predicate is the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">difference of the Notion;&nbsp;</em>and thus the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">totality&nbsp;</em>of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">species&nbsp;</em>in the predicate cannot be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">any other difference. The reciprocal determination&nbsp;</em>of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">disjunctive&nbsp;</em>terms is therefore given by this. It reduces to the difference of the Notion, for it is this alone that disjoins itself and in its determination reveals its negative unity. However, the species is considered here only in respect of its simple Notion determinateness, not in respect of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">shape</em>&nbsp;in which it has come forth from the Idea into a further self-subsistent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reality;&nbsp;</em>this latter is indeed&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dropped&nbsp;</em>in the simple principle of the genus; but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">essential&nbsp;</em>distinction must be a moment of the Notion. In the judgment here considered, it is really the Notion&#39;s own progressive determination that now&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posits</em>&nbsp;its disjunction; the same thing that we found, when considering the Notion, to be its essential and explicit determination, its differentiation into determinate Notions. Now because the Notion is the universal, both the positive and the negative totality of the particulars, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">itself&nbsp;</em>for that very reason also immediately&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one of its disjunctive members; the other,&nbsp;</em>however, is this universality resolved into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its particularity,&nbsp;</em>or the determinateness of the Notion&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as determinateness,&nbsp;</em>that determinateness in which the universality exhibits itself as totality. If the disjunction of a genus into species has not yet attained this form, this is a proof that it has not risen to the determinateness of the Notion and has not proceeded from the Notion.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Colour&nbsp;</em>is either violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange or red; even the empirical confusion and impurity of such a disjunction is at once apparent; just from this aspect alone it must be termed barbarous. When colour has been grasped as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete unity&nbsp;</em>of light and dark, then this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">genus</em>&nbsp;contains within it the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>which constitutes the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">principle</em>of its particularisation into species. But of these species, one must be the utterly simple colour which contains the opposition in equipose and confined and negated in the colour&#39;s intensity; over against this there must be presented the opposition of the relationship between light and dark, to which must be added, since a natural phenomenon is involved, the indifferent neutrality of the opposition. When mixtures such as violet and orange, and differences of degree, such as blue and light blue, are taken for species, this can only result from a completely thoughtless procedure that shows too little reflection even for empiricism. But this is not the place to discuss what further distinct and more precisely determined forms disjunction may have, according as they occur in the element of Nature or of spirit.</p>

The thing itself is just this, that its Notion, as the negative of itself, negates its universality and projects itself into the externality of individuality. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subject&nbsp;</em>of the judgment is here posited as this duality; those opposite significations of subjectivity are, in accordance with their truth, brought into a unity. The signification of the subjective element has itself become problematic by reason of its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">having lost&nbsp;</em>the immediate deter<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">minateness&nbsp;</em>which it possessed in the immediate judgment, and its determinate&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposition&nbsp;</em>to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">predicate.&nbsp;</em>This opposite signification of subjective which occurs even in the ratiocination of ordinary reflection might of itself at least draw attention to the fact that subjectivity in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one&nbsp;</em>of these significations alone, has no truth. The twofold signification is the manifestation of this truth that each by itself is one-sided.</p>

But in reason the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate</em>&nbsp;Notions are posited in their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">totality and unity.&nbsp;</em>Therefore, not only is the syllogism rational, but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">everything rational is a syllogism.&nbsp;</em>The syllogistic process has for a long time been ascribed to reason; yet on the other hand reason in and for itself, rational principles and laws, are spoken of in such a way that it is not clear what is the connection between the former reason which syllogises and the latter reason which is the source of laws and other eternal truths and absolute thoughts. If the former is supposed to be merely formal reason, while the latter is supposed to be creative of content, then according to this distinction it is precisely the form of reason, the syllogism, that must not be lacking in the latter. Nevertheless, to such a degree are the two commonly held apart, and not mentioned together, that it seems as though the reason of absolute thoughts was ashamed of the reason of the syllogism and as though it was only in deference to tradition that the syllogism was also adduced as an activity of reason. Yet it is obvious, as we have just remarked, that the logical reason, if it is regarded as formal reason, must essentially be recognisable also in the reason that is concerned with a content; the fact is that no content can be rational except through the rational form. In this matter we cannot look for any help in the common chatter about reason; for this refrains from stating what is to be understood by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reason;&nbsp;</em>this supposedly rational cognition is mostly so busy with its objects that it forgets to cognise reason itself and only distinguishes and characterises it by the objects that it possesses. If reason is supposed to be the cognition that knows about God, freedom, right and duty, the infinite, unconditioned, supersensuous, or even gives only ideas and feelings of these objects, then for one thing these latter are only negative objects, and for another thing the first question still remains, what it is in all these objects that makes them rational. It is this, that the infinitude of these objects is not the empty abstraction from the finite, not the universality that lacks content and determinateness, but the universality that is fulfilled or realised, the Notion that is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>and possesses its determinateness in this true way, namely, that it differentiates itself within itself and is the unity of these fixed and determinate differences. It is only thus that reason&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">rises&nbsp;</em>above the finite, conditioned, sensuous, call it what you will, and in this negativity is essentially&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pregnant with content,&nbsp;</em>for it is the unity of determinate extremes; as such, however, the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">rational&nbsp;</em>is nothing but the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">syllogism.</em></p>

It is still subjective in so far as the abstract significance possessed by its terms is not thus isolated in and for itself but only in subjective consciousness. Moreover, the relationship of individuality, particularity and universality is as we have seen the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessary and essential form-relationship&nbsp;</em>of the determinations of the syllogism; the defect consists not in this determinateness of the form, but in the fact that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">under this form&nbsp;</em>each single determination is not at the same time&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">richer.&nbsp;</em>Aristotle has confined himself rather to the mere relationship of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inherence,&nbsp;</em>in stating the nature of the syllogism as follows:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">When three terms are related to one another in such a manner that one extreme is in the whole of the middle term and this middle term is in the whole of the other extreme, then these two extremes are necessarily united in a conclusion.&nbsp;</em>What is expressed here is more the mere repetition of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">like relationship&nbsp;</em>of inherence between one extreme to the middle term, and again between the middle term and the other extreme, than the determinateness of the three terms to one another. Now since the syllogism rests on the stated relative determinateness of the terms, it is immediately evident that other relationships of the terms which are given by the other figures can only have validity as syllogisms of the under<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">standing [Verstandesschlusse]&nbsp;</em>in so far as they can be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reduced&nbsp;</em>to that original relationship; they are not<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">different species&nbsp;</em>of figures which stand&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alongside the first;&nbsp;</em>on the contrary, on the one hand, in so far as they purport to be correct syllogisms, they rest solely on the essential form of the syllogism in general, which is the first figure; on the other hand, in so far as they deviate from it they are transformations into which that first abstract form necessarily passes, thereby further determining itself and advancing to totality. We shall presently see what this process is.</p>

The individual is subsumed under the particular, and the latter under the universal; therefore the individual too is subsumed under the universal. Or the particular inheres in the individual and the universal in the particular;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">therefore</em>&nbsp;the universal also inheres in the individual. From one aspect, namely, in relation to the universal, the particular is subject; in relation to the individual it is predicate; or, in relation to the former it is an individual, in relation to the latter it is a universal. Because the two determinatenesses are united in it, the extremes are linked together by this their unity. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">therefore</em>appears as the conclusion that has taken place in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subject, a</em>&nbsp;conclusion deduced from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subjective&nbsp;</em>insight into the relationship between the two&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>premises. As subjective reflection enunciates the two relations of the middle term to the extremes as particular and indeed immediate&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">judgments or propositions, the</em>&nbsp;conclusion as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediated&nbsp;</em>relation is also, of course, a particular<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proposition,&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consequently or therefore&nbsp;</em>is the expression of the fact that it is the mediated one. But this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">therefore&nbsp;</em>is not to be regarded as an external determination in this proposition, as if it had its ground and seat only in subjective reflection; on the contrary, it is grounded in the nature of the extremes themselves whose&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>again is expressed as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mere judgment or proposition</em>&nbsp;only for the purpose of, and by means of, abstractive reflection, but whose&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">true relation&nbsp;</em>is posited as the middle term. That&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">therefore I is U</em>&nbsp;is a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">judgment,&nbsp;</em>is a merely subjective circumstance; the very meaning of the syllogism is that this is not merely a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">judgment,&nbsp;</em>that is, not a relation effected by the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mere copula&nbsp;</em>or the empty is, but one effected by the determinate middle term which is pregnant with content.</p>

This syllogistic process that advances by means of separate propositions is nothing but a subjective form; the nature of the fact is that the differentiated Notion determinations of the fact are united in the essential unity.</p>

It may thus be regarded as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative&nbsp;</em>syllogism, just as the judgment of existence has the same aspect of qualitative determination. Accordingly the terms of this syllogism, like the terms of that judgment, are individual determinatenesses, the determinateness through its self-relation being posited as indifferent to the form and hence as content. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individual&nbsp;</em>is any immediate concrete object;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">particularity&nbsp;</em>a single one of its determinatenesses, properties or relationships;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality&nbsp;</em>again a still more abstract, more individual determinateness in the particular&#39; Since the subject as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediately&nbsp;</em>determined is not yet posited in its Notion, its concretion is not reduced to the essential Notion determinations; its self-related determinateness is, therefore, an indeterminate, infinite&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">multiplicity.&nbsp;</em>In this immediacy the individual possesses an infinite number of determinatenesses which belong to its particularity, each of which therefore may constitute a middle term for it in a syllogism. But through&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">any other</em>middle term it is united&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with another universal;</em>&nbsp;through each of its properties it stands in a different connection and context of existence. Further, the middle term is also a concrete in comparison with the universal; it contains several predicates itself, and the individual in turn can be united through the same middle term with several universals. In general, therefore, it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is completely contingent and arbitrary&nbsp;</em>which of the many properties is adopted for the purpose of connecting it with a predicate; other middle terms are transitions to other predicates, and even the same middle term may by itself be a transition to various predicates, for as a particular against the universal it contains several determinations.</p>

For difference in general, which in the first instance is an indifferent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">diversity,&nbsp;</em>is no less essentially&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposition.&nbsp;</em>The concrete is no longer something belonging merely to the sphere of Appearance, but is concrete through the unity in the Notion of the opposites that have become determined as moments of the Notion. Now when, in accordance with the qualitative nature of the terms in the formal syllogism, the concrete is grasped in respect of a single one of the determinations belonging to it, the syllogism assigns to it the predicate corresponding to this middle term; but as from another side the opposite determinateness is inferred, this shows the former conclusion to be false, although its premises by themselves and equally its inference are quite correct. If from the middle term, that a wall has been painted blue, it is inferred that therefore the wall is blue, this is a correct inference; yet in spite of this syllogism the wall can be green if it has also been painted over yellow, from which latter circumstance taken by itself it would follow that it was yellow. If from the middle term of sense-nature it is inferred that man is neither good nor evil, because neither the one nor the other can be predicated of sense, the syllogism is correct but the conclusion is false; because as man is a concrete being, the middle term of spirituality is equally valid. From the middle term of the gravitation of the planets, satellites and comets towards the sun, it correctly follows that these bodies fall into the sun; but they do not fall into it, because each is no less its own centre of gravity, or, as it is said, they are impelled by centrifugal force. Similarly, from the middle term of sociality we can deduce the community of goods among citizens, but from the middle term of individuality, if it is pursued with equal abstractness, there follows the dissolution of the state, as has happened for example in the Holy Roman Empire from holding to the latter middle term. It is justly held that there is nothing so inadequate as a formal syllogism of this kind, since it is a matter of chance or caprice which middle term is employed. No matter how elegantly a deduction of this kind has run its course through syllogisms, however fully its correctness may be conceded it still leads to nothing of the slightest consequence, for the fact always remains that there are still other middle terms from which the exact opposite can be deduced with equal correctness.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_671"></a><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">The Kantian&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">antinomies</em>&nbsp;of reason amount to nothing more than that from a notion first one of its determinations is laid down as basis, and then with equal necessity, the other</span>. In these cases this inadequacy and contingency of a syllogism must not merely be shifted on to the content, as though these defects were independent of the form and the latter alone were the concern of logic. On the contrary, it lies in the form of the formal syllogism that the content is such a one-sided quality; it is determined to this one-sidedness by the said&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract</em>&nbsp;form.&nbsp;</p>

Now in the formal syllogism the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>relation or the qualitative judgment is the basis, and the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediation&nbsp;</em>of the syllogism that which is posited as the higher truth over against it. The unending process of proving the premises does not resolve this contradiction but only perpetually renews it and is the repetition of one and the same original defect. The truth of the infinite progression consists, on the contrary, in the sublation of the progression itself and the form which is already determined by it as defective. This form is that of mediation as I-P-U. The two relations I-P and P-U are to be mediated relations; if this is effected in the same way the defective form I-P-U will merely be duplicated, and so on to infinity. P has to I also the form determination of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal,</em>and to U the form determination of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individual,&nbsp;</em>because these relations are, in general, judgments. Therefore they require mediation; but mediation in the form just mentioned only results in the re-appearance of the relationship that was to have been sublated.</p>

As regards content, therefore, the mediation is not anything necessary or universal; it is not grounded in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion of the fact;&nbsp;</em>on the contrary, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ground of</em>&nbsp;the syllogism is something external to it, that is, something immediate; but among the Notion-determinations the immediate is the individual. As regards the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form, the mediation&nbsp;</em>likewise has for its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposition the immediacy of the relation;&nbsp;</em>therefore the mediation is itself mediated, and mediated by the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate,&nbsp;</em>that is, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individual.&nbsp;</em>More precisely, through the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">conclusion&nbsp;</em>of the first syllogism, the individual has become the mediating factor. The conclusion is I-U;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the individual&nbsp;</em>is thereby posited as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal</em>&nbsp;In one premise, the minor I-P, it is already present as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">particular;</em>&nbsp;hence it is that in which these two determinations are united. Or we may say that the conclusion in and for itself enunciates the individual as a universal, and that too not in an immediate manner but through mediation; consequently as a necessary relation. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple&nbsp;</em>particularity was the middle term; in the conclusion this particularity is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>in its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">developed&nbsp;</em>form as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation of the individual and universality.&nbsp;</em>But the universal is still a qualitative determinateness, a predicate of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individual;&nbsp;</em>the individual in being determined as a universal is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>as the universality of the extremes or as the middle term; by itself it is the extreme of individuality, but because it is now determined as a universal it is at the same time the unity of the two extremes.</p>

The transition of this pure form into another figure is on the one hand the beginning of the realisation of the Notion, in that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative</em>&nbsp;moment of mediation, and thereby a further determinateness of form, is posited in the initially immediate qualitative determinateness of the terms. But this is at the same time an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alteration&nbsp;</em>of the pure form of the syllogism; the latter no longer completely corresponds to its pure form, and the determinateness posited in its terms differs from the original form determination. Regarded merely as a subjective syllogism proceeding in an external reflection, it counts as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">species&nbsp;</em>of syllogism which ought to correspond to the genus, namely to the general schema I-P-U. But to begin with it does not correspond to this; its two premises are P-I, or I-P, and I-U; hence the middle term is in both cases subsumed or in both cases the subject, in which accordingly the two other terms inhere. It is therefore not a middle term, for this should on the one hand subsume or be predicate, and on the other hand be subsumed or be subject, or one of the terms should inhere in it while it itself inheres in the other. The true meaning of the fact that this syllogism does not correspond to the general form of the syllogism, is that the general form has passed over into this syllogism since the truth of that form consists in its being a subjective and contingent connecting of the terms. If the conclusion in the second figure (that is, without taking advantage of the restriction about to be mentioned, which converts it into something indeterminate) is correct, then it is so because it is so on its own account, not because it is the conclusion of this syllogism. But the same is the case with the conclusion of the first figure; it is this, its truth, that is posited by the second figure. In the view that holds the second figure to be merely one species, the necessary transition of the first into this second form is overlooked and the former is adhered to as the true form. Consequently, if in the second figure (which from ancient custom is quoted without further reasons as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the third</em>) we are likewise supposed to have a syllogism&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">correct&nbsp;</em>in this subjective sense, then it would have to be conformable to the first; hence, since one premise I-U has the relationship of the subsumption of the middle term under one extreme, then it would have to be possible to give the other premise,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">P-I,&nbsp;</em>the opposite relation to that which it has and to subsume P under I. But such a relation would be the sublation of the determinate judgment I is P, and could only occur in an indeterminate, in a particular judgment; consequently the conclusion in this figure can only be particular. The particular judgment, however, as remarked above, is both positive and negative &mdash; a conclusion to which for that very reason no great value can be attached. Since too the particular and universal are the extremes, and are immediate, mutually indifferent determinatenesses, their relationship is itself indifferent; either can be taken at choice as major or minor term and therefore, too, either premise can be taken as major or minor.</p>

But since this universal is at the same time distinguished as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract&nbsp;</em>from the extremes as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate,&nbsp;</em>it is itself still a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>relatively to them, and the whole is a syllogism whose relation to its Notion has now to be considered. The middle term, as the universal, is the subsuming term or predicate to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">both&nbsp;</em>its extremes, and does not occur once as subsumed or as subject. In so far, therefore, as it is supposed to correspond, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a species&nbsp;</em>of syllogism, to the syllogism, it can do so only on condition that when one relation I-U, already possesses the proper relationship, the other relation U-P also possesses it. This occurs in a judgment in which the relationship of subject and predicate is indifferent, in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative&nbsp;</em>judgment. In this way the syllogism becomes legitimate, but the conclusion necessarily negative.</p>

Since on the common assumption it depends on this which of the premises is to be major and which minor, this too has become a matter of indifference. This is the ground of the ordinary fourth figure of the syllogism, a figure unknown to Aristotle and which in any case is concerned with a wholly empty and pointless distinction. In it the immediate position of the terms is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reverse&nbsp;</em>of their position in the first figure. Since subject and predicate of the negative conclusion in the formal treatment of the judgment do not have the definite relationship of subject and predicate, but either can take the place of the other, it is indifferent which term is taken as subject and which as predicate; therefore equally indifferent which premise is taken as major and which as minor. This indifference, aided as it is by the determination of particularity (especially when it is observed that this can be taken in the comprehensive sense) makes this fourth figure a sheer futility.</p>

But now since the universal is determined as the middle term, and the determinateness of the extremes is not contained in it, this middle term is posited as a wholly indifferent and external one.</p>

But for this very reason it is not without presupposition or unmediated; the quantitative determination, which is the only thing in it taken into account, is<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only through abstraction from</em>&nbsp;qualitative difference and from the determinations of the Notion. Lines, figures, posited as equal to one another, are understood only in terms of their magnitude; a triangle is affirmed to be equal to a square, but not as triangle to square, but only in regard to magnitude, etc. Similarly, the Notion and its determinations do not enter into this syllogising; there is no<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">comprehending&nbsp;</em>at all [that is, in terms of the Notion] in this process; and understanding too has not even the formal, abstract determinations of the Notion before it.

Some remarks on the ordinary view and mode of treatment of the syllogism in logic will be in place here. It is a familiar fact that this doctrine was elaborated into such finely drawn distinctions that its so-called subtleties have been the object of universal aversion and disgust. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">natural understanding&nbsp;</em>in asserting itself in every department of mental and spiritual culture against the unsubstantial forms of reflection, also turned against this artificial knowledge of the form of reason and supposed itself able to dispense with such a science on the ground that it performed the individual operations of thought specified therein naturally and spontaneously without any special instruction. In point of fact, if a precondition of rational thinking were the laborious study of syllogistic formulae, mankind would in that respect be in the same sorry plight as they would be, as already remarked in the Preface in another respect, if they could not walk or digest without having studied anatomy and physiology. Granting that the study of these sciences may not be without profit for the regulation of one&#39;s diet, we must undoubtedly credit the study of the forms of reason with an even more important influence on the correctness of thinking. But without going into this aspect of the matter which concerns the education of subjective thinking and therefore, strictly speaking, pedagogics, it must be admitted that the study which has for its subject matter the modes and laws of operation of reason, must in its own self be of the greatest interest-of an interest at least not inferior to an acquaintance with the laws of nature and of her particular forms. If it is not thought a small matter to have discovered some sixty species of parrots, one hundred and thirty-seven species of veronica, etc., much less ought it to be thought a small matter to discover the forms of reason; is not a figure of the syllogism something infinitely superior to a species of parrot or veronica?</p>

Its defect consists in its simply stopping short at the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">understanding&#39;s form&nbsp;</em>of the syllogism in which the Notion determinations are taken as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract,&nbsp;</em>formal terms. It is all the more inconsequent to cling to these determinations as abstract qualities, since in the syllogism it is their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relations&nbsp;</em>that constitute the essential feature, and inherence and subsumption already imply that the individual, because the universal inhe.-es in it, is itself a universal, and the universal, because it subsumes the individual, is itself an individual; more exactly, the syllogism expressly posits this very&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity as middle term,&nbsp;</em>and its determination is precisely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediation,</em>&nbsp;that is, the Notion determinations no longer, as in the judgment, have for basis their mutual externality, but rather their unity. It is thus the Notion of the syllogism that declares the imperfection of the formal syllogism in which the middle term is fixedly held, not as unity of the extremes but as a formal, abstract determination qualitatively distinct from them. The treatment is rendered still less meaningful by the fact that also relations or judgments in which even formal determinations become indifferent, as in negative and particular judgments, and which therefore approximate to propositions, are still regarded as perfect relationships. Now since the qualitative form&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">I-P- U&nbsp;</em>is generally accepted as the ultimate and absolute, the dialectical treatment of the syllogism no longer operates; the remaining syllogisms are consequently regarded not as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">necessary alterations&nbsp;</em>of that first form but as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">species.&nbsp;</em>In this case, it is indifferent whether the first formal syllogism itself is regarded only as a kind of species&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">alongside the</em>&nbsp;rest, or as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">genus and species&nbsp;</em>at the same time; the latter occurs when the other syllogisms are reduced to the first.

Because the syllogism is this contradiction, it is in its own nature dialectical. Its dialectical movement exhibits it in each of the moments of the Notion, so that not only the above relationship of subsumption or particularity, but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equally essentially&nbsp;</em>negative unity and universality are moments in the union of the extremes. In so far as each of these by itself is equally only a one-sided moment of particularity, they are likewise imperfect middle terms, but at the same time they constitute the developed determinations of the middle term; the entire course through the three figures presents the middle term in each of these determinations, and the true result that emerges from it is that the middle is not an individual Notion determination but the totality of them all.</p>

It has been shown that the abstract determination, on account of its abstract relation-to-self, can equally be regarded as content; this being so, the formal syllogism merely serves to show that a relation of a subject to a predicate follows or does not follow&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only from this middle term.&nbsp;</em>Nothing is gained in having proved a proposition by a syllogism of this kind; on account of the abstract determinateness of the middle term, which is a Notionless quality, other middle terms can just as well be given from which the opposite follows; in fact, from the same middle term opposite predicates may in turn be deduced by further syllogisms. Besides being of little service, the formal syllogism is also a very simple affair; the numerous rules which have been invented are tiresome not only because they contrast so strongly with the simple nature of the fact but also because they relate to cases where the formal worth of the syllogism is furthermore diminished by the external form determination, above all, particularity (especially as for this purpose it must be taken in a comprehensive sense), and where even in respect of form nothing but completely worthless results are deduced. However, the most merited and most important aspect of the disfavour into which syllogistic doctrine has fallen is that this doctrine is such a long-drawn out, notionless occupation with a subject matter whose sole content is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>itself. The numerous syllogistic rules remind one of the procedure of arithmeticians who similarly give a host of rules about arithmetical operations, all of which rules presuppose that one has not the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>of the operation. But numbers are a notionless material and the operations of arithmetic are an external combining or separating of them, a mechanical procedure-indeed, calculating machines have been invented which perform these operations; whereas it is the harshest and most glaring of contradictions when the form determinations of the syllogism, which are Notions, are treated as a notionless material.</p>

Leibniz makes much of the usefulness of the analysis of combinations for ascertaining not only the forms of the syllogism but also the combinations of other concepts. The operation by which this is ascertained is the same as that by which it is calculated how many combinations of letters are possible in an alphabet, how many throws are possible in a game of dice, how many kinds of play with an ombre card, etc. Here therefore we find the determinations of the syllogism put in the same class with the points of the die and the ombre card, the rational is taken as a dead and non-rational thing, and the characteristic feature of the Notion and its determinations as spiritual essences&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">to relate themselves&nbsp;</em>and through this relating to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sublate their immediate&nbsp;</em>determination, is ignored. This Leibnizian application of the calculus of combinations and permutations to the syllogism and to the combination of other notions, differed from the notorious&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Art of Lully</em>&nbsp;solely in being more methodical on the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">arithmetical&nbsp;</em>side, but for the rest, they were both equally meaningless. Connected with this was a pet idea of Leibniz, embraced by him in his youth, and in spite of its immaturity and shallowness not relinquished by him even in later life, the idea of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">characteristica universalis&nbsp;</em>of notions-a language of symbols in which each notion would be represented as a relation proceeding from others or in its relation to others as though in rational combinations, which is essentially dialectical, a content still retained the same determinations&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">that it possesses when fixed in isolation.</em></p>

It rests upon the abstraction from the difference of relationship, from the difference of individuality, particularity and universality in the judgment and upon strict adherence to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract identity&nbsp;</em>of subject and predicate whereby they are in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mathematical equality</em>&nbsp;&mdash; in a relation which converts the syllogising process into a completely meaningless and tautological formulation of propositions. In the proposition:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the rose is red,&nbsp;</em>the predicate is not to denote red in general but only the specific&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">red of the rose;&nbsp;</em>in the proposition:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">all Christians are men,&nbsp;</em>the predicate is to denote only those men who are Christians; from this proposition and the proposition:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the Jews are not Christians,&nbsp;</em>there follows the conclusion (which did not particularly commend this syllogistic calculus to Mendelssohn)&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">therefore the Jews are not men&nbsp;</em>(namely, not those men that the Christians are). Ploucquet states as a consequence of his discovery:&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&#39;posse etiam rudes mechanics totam logicam doceri, uti pueri arithmeticam docentur, ita quidem, ut nulla formidine in ratiociniis suis errands torqueri, vel fallaciis circumveniri possint, si in calculo non errant.&#39;&nbsp;</em>This recommendation, that by means of the calculus the whole of logic can be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mechanically&nbsp;</em>brought within reach of the uneducated, is surely the worst thing that can be said of a discovery bearing on the presentation of the science of logic.</p>

That the middle term in it is not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract&nbsp;</em>particularity but is developed into its moments and is therefore concrete, is indeed an essential requirement for the Notion; but the form of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">allness&nbsp;</em>so far only gathers the individual externally into universality, and conversely still preserves the individual in the universality as something possessing immediately a separate self-subsistence. The negation of the immediacy of the determinations which was the result of the syllogism of existence, is only the first negation, not yet the negation of the negation or absolute reflection into self. Therefore the single determinations still form the basis of the universality of reflection that embraces them within itself; in other words, allness is still not the universality of the Notion but the external universality of reflection.</p>

But since the middle term now contains&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individuality&nbsp;</em>and is thereby itself concrete, it can only serve to connect the subject with a predicate which belongs to the subject as concrete. If for example from the middle term&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">green&nbsp;</em>it should be inferred that a picture was pleasing because green is pleasing to the eye, or that a poem or building was beautiful because it possessed&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">regularity,&nbsp;</em>the picture, etc., might all the same be ugly on account of other qualities from which this latter predicate could be inferred. On the other hand, since the middle term has the determination of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">allness,&nbsp;</em>it contains the greenness or regularity as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a concrete,</em>which just for that reason is not the abstraction of something merely green or merely regular; with this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete&nbsp;</em>then only those predicates can be connected which conform to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the totality of the concrete&nbsp;</em>thing. In the judgment: what is green or regular is pleasing, the subject is only the abstraction of green or regularity; in the proposition: all green or regular things are pleasing, the subject is, on the contrary: all actual concrete objects that are green or regular &mdash;objects, therefore, which are taken as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete with all their properties</em>that they possess besides greenness or regularity.</p>

Lion, elephant, and so on constitute the genus of quadruped; the difference, that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">same</em>&nbsp;content is posited once in individuality and again in universality, is accordingly a mere<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifferent determination of&nbsp;</em>form-an indifference which is the result of the formal syllogism posited in the syllogism of reflection, and here is posited through the equality of extension.</p>

Therefore, strictly speaking, it rather presupposes its conclusion as something immediate, just as the syllogism of allness presupposes the conclusion for one of its premises.&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">An experience that rests on induction is accepted as valid&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">although</em>&nbsp;the perception is admittedly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">incomplete</em>; but the assumption that no&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contradictory instance</em>&nbsp;of that experience can arise is only possible if the experience is true&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in and for itself</em>.</span>&nbsp;Thus the syllogism by induction, though indeed based on an immediacy, is not based on that immediacy on which it is supposed to be based, on the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">merely affirmative</em>&nbsp;immediacy of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individuality</em>, but on the immediacy which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in and for itself</em>, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal</em>&nbsp;immediacy. The fundamental character of induction is that it is a syllogism; if individuality is taken as the essential, but universality as only the external, determination of the middle term, then the middle term would fall asunder into two unconnected parts and we should not have a syllogism; this externality belongs rather to the extremes. It is only as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediately identical</em>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality</em>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individuality</em>&nbsp;can be the middle term; such universality is properly<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objective</em>&nbsp;universality, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">genus</em>&nbsp;[Kind]. This may also be looked at in this way: universality is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external but essential</em>&nbsp;in the determination of individuality that forms the basis of the middle term of induction; but such an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external</em>&nbsp;is no less immediately its opposite, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">internal</em>. The truth of the syllogism of induction is, therefore, a syllogism that has for its middle term an individuality that is immediately in its own self universality; this is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">syllogism of analogy</em>.&nbsp;</p>

Super</em>ficiality of this kind, however, to which a form of understanding or reason is reduced by being degraded to the sphere of mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">representation,&nbsp;</em>should not find a place in logic at all. Also it is improper to represent the major premise of this syllogism as though it should run: that which resembles an object in some characteristics resembles it in others also. By so doing, the form&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of the syllogism&nbsp;</em>is expressed in the shape of a content, while the empirical content, the content properly so called, is relegated to the minor premise. In this way the whole form, for example, of the first syllogism, could be expressed as its major premise:<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">That which is subsumed under some other thing in which a third inheres, has also that third inherent in it: now&nbsp;</em>.... and so forth. But the importance of the syllogism itself does not depend on the empirical content, and to convert its own form into the content of a major premise is no less a matter of indifference than to take any other empirical content for that purpose. But in so far as the importance of the syllogism of analogy does not depend on the former content which contains nothing but the form peculiar to the syllogism, then the importance of the first syllogism would not depend on it either, that is to say, would not depend on that which makes the syllogism a syllogism. The main point always is the form of the syllogism, whether it have the form itself or something else for its empirical content. Thus the syllogism of analogy is a peculiar form, and it is quite futile not to regard it as such on the ground that its form can be converted into the content or matter of a major premise, whereas logic is not concerned with the matter. What may lead to this misunderstanding in the case of the syllogism of analogy and perhaps also in the case of the syllogism of induction, is that in them the middle term and the extremes, too, are further determined than in the merely formal syllogism, and therefore the form determination, because it is no longer simple and abstract, must appear also as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determination of content.&nbsp;</em>But the fact that the form determines itself to content in this way is in the first place a necessary advance of the formal element and therefore essentially concerns the nature of the syllogism; and therefore, secondly, a content determination of this kind cannot be regarded in the same way as any other empirical content, nor can abstraction be made from it.</p>

There are two individuals,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thirdly</em>, a property immediately assumed as common, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">fourthly&nbsp;</em>the other property which one individual immediately possesses but which the other first obtains through the syllogism. This arises from the fact that, as we have seen, in the analogical syllogism the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">middle term&nbsp;</em>is posited as individuality, but immediately also as the true universality of the latter. In<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">induction,&nbsp;</em>the middle term is, apart from the two extremes, an indeterminable number of individuals; in this syllogism therefore an infinite number of terms ought to be enumerated. In the syllogism of allness the universality in the middle term is so far merely the external form determination of allness; in the syllogism of analogy, on the contrary, it is essential universality. In the above example the middle term,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the earth,&nbsp;</em>is taken as a concrete that in its truth is as much a universal nature or genus as an individual.</p>

Yet it does so from another aspect; for although one subject has the same universal nature as the other, it is undetermined whether the determinateness which is inferred for the second subject belongs to the first by virtue of its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">nature&nbsp;</em>or by virtue of its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">particularity;&nbsp;</em>whether for example the earth is inhabited as a heavenly body&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in general,&nbsp;</em>or only as this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">particular&nbsp;</em>heavenly body. Analogy is still a syllogism of reflection inasmuch as individuality and universality are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediately&nbsp;</em>united in its middle term. On account of this immediacy, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality</em>&nbsp;of the unity of reflection is still with us; the individual is only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>the genus, it is not posited in that negativity by which its determinateness would be the determinateness proper to the genus itself. For this reason the predicate which belongs to the individual of the middle term is not already predicate of the other individual although both belong to the one genus.</p>

Hence this syllogism is in its own self the demand for itself to counter the immediacy which it contains, in other words it presupposes its conclusion. A syllogism of existence has its presupposition in the other syllogisms of existence; in the case of the syllogisms just considered the presupposition has been placed within them, because they are syllogisms of reflection. Since then the syllogism of analogy is the demand for its own mediation against the immediacy with which its mediation is burdened, it is the moment of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individuality&nbsp;</em>whose sublation it demands. Thus there remains for middle term the objective universal, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">genus,&nbsp;</em>purged of immediacy. In the syllogism of analogy the genus was a moment of the middle term only as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate presupposition;&nbsp;</em>since the syllogism itself demands the sublation of the presupposed immediacy, the negation of the individuality, and consequently the universal, is no longer immediate, but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited.&nbsp;</em>The syllogism of reflection contained only the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first</em>&nbsp;negation of immediacy; now the second has appeared, and with it the external universality of reflection is determined into universality in and for itself. Regarded from the positive side the conclusion shows itself to be identical with the premise, the mediation as having coincided with its presupposition; thus there is an identity of the universality of reflection by which it has become a higher universality.</p>

But the individual is not united with universality in this merely positive manner but is sublated in it and a negative moment; thus the universal is that whose essential being has become actual, the posited genus, and the individual as immediate is rather the externality of the genus, or it is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">extreme.&nbsp;</em>The syllogism of reflection taken in general comes under the schema P-I-U, in which the individual is still as such the essential determination of the middle term; but in that its immediacy has sublated itself, and the middle term has determined itself as the universality that is in and for itself, the syllogism has entered under the formal schema I-U-P, and the syllogism of reflection has passed over into the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">syllogism of necessity.</em></p>

But further, this contingency does not merely belong to the external reflection which finds the individual posited in the syllogism to be contingent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">by comparison&nbsp;</em>with others; on the contrary, it is because the individual itself is related to the middle term as to its objective universality that it is posited as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contingent,&nbsp;</em>as a subjective actuality. On the other hand, in that the subject is an<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>individual, it contains determinations which are not contained in the middle term as the universal nature; therefore it also has a specific nature of its own indifferent to the middle term and possessing a content peculiar to itself. Hence, conversely, this other term also has an indifferent immediacy and an Existence distinct from the former. The same relationship also obtains between the middle term and the other extreme; for this likewise has the determination of immediacy and hence of a being that is contingent relatively to its middle term.</p>

The disjunctive syllogism is in general in the determination of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality;&nbsp;</em>its middle term is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">A as genus&nbsp;</em>and as perfectly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate;&nbsp;</em>through this unity, that content which previously was inner is also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>and, conversely, the positedness or form is not the external, negative unity over against an indifferent existence, but is identical with the said substantial content. The whole form determination of the Notion is posited in its determinate difference and at the same time in the simple identity of the Notion.</p>

This formal or subjective side consisted in the fact that the mediating factor of the extremes is the Notion as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract</em>determination, and this latter is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">distinct&nbsp;</em>from the extremes whose unity it is. In the consummation of the syllogism, on the other hand, where objective universality is no less posited as totality of the form determinations, the distinction of mediating and mediated has disappeared. That which is mediated is itself an essential moment of what mediates it, and each moment appears as the totality of what is mediated.</p>

In the syllogisms of reflection the middle term appears as the unity that gathers together&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externally&nbsp;</em>the determinations of the extremes. In the syllogism of necessity it has likewise determined itself to the unity that is no less developed and total than simple, and the form of the syllogism which consisted in the difference of the middle term from its extremes has thereby sublated itself.</p>

In this way it is still the inwardness of this its externality, but the outcome of the course of the syllogisms is that this externality is equated with the inner unity; the various determinations return into this unity through the mediation in which at first they are united only in a third term, and thus the externality exhibits in its own self the Notion, which therefore is no longer distinguished from it as an inner unity.</p>

In Book Two, essence reveals itself as determining itself into ground, thereby entering into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Existence&nbsp;</em>and realising itself as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substance,&nbsp;</em>but again withdrawing into the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion.&nbsp;</em>Of the Notion, now, we have shown to begin with that it determines itself into<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objectivity.&nbsp;</em>It is self-evident that this latter transition is identical in character with what formerly appeared in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">metaphysics</em>&nbsp;as the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inference&nbsp;</em>from the notion, namely, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">notion of God, to his existence,&nbsp;</em>or as the so-called&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ontological proof&nbsp;</em>of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existence of God.</em>It is equally well known that Descartes&#39; sublimest thought, that God is that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">whose notion includes within itself its being,&nbsp;</em>after being degraded into the defective form of the formal syllogism, that is, into the form of the said proof, finally succumbed to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Critique of Reason&nbsp;</em>and to the thought that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existence cannot be extracted from the notion.&nbsp;</em>Some points connected with this proof have already been elucidated. In Vol. 1, pp. 86 sqq., where&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>has vanished in its immediate opposite,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">non-being</em>, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">becoming</em>&nbsp;has shown itself as the truth of both, attention was drawn to the confusion that arises when, in the case of a particular determinate being, what is fixed on is not the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>of that determinate being but its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate content;&nbsp;</em>then, comparing&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">this determinate content,&nbsp;</em>for example a hundred dollars, with another&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate content,&nbsp;</em>for example, with the context of my perception or the state of my finances, it is found that it makes a difference whether the former content is added to the latter or not &ndash; and it is imagined that what has been discussed is the difference between being and non-being, or even the difference between being and the Notion. Further, in the same Vol., p. 112 and Vol. II, p. 442 we elucidated a determination that occurs in the ontological proof, that of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a sum-total of all realities.&nbsp;</em>But the essential subject matter of that proof,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the connection of the Notion and determinate being,&nbsp;</em>is the concern of our consideration of the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>just concluded, and the entire course through which the Notion determines itself into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objectivity.&nbsp;</em>The Notion, as absolutely self-identical negativity, is self-determining; we have remarked that the Notion, in determining itself into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">judgment&nbsp;</em>in individuality, is already positing itself as something real, something that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is;&nbsp;</em>this still abstract reality completes itself in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objectivity.</em></p>

On the other hand however it is essential to bear in mind the remark made above that the subject only obtains determinateness and content in its predicate; until then, no matter what it may be for feeling, intuition and pictorial thinking, for rational cognition it is only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">name;&nbsp;</em>but in the predicate with its determinateness there begins, at the same time,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">realisation&nbsp;</em>in general. The predicates, however, must be grasped as themselves still included within the Notion, hence as something subjective, which so far has not emerged into existence; to this extent we must admit on the one hand that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the realisation&nbsp;</em>of the Notion in the judgment is still not complete. On the other hand however the mere determination of an object by predicates, when that determination is not at the same time the realisation and objectifying of the Notion, also remains something so subjective that it is not even the genuine cognition and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determination of the Notion&nbsp;</em>of the object-subjective in the sense of abstract reflection and uncomprehended pictorial thinking. God, as the living God, and still more as absolute spirit, is known only in his&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">activity;&nbsp;</em>man was early instructed to recognise God in his&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">works;&nbsp;</em>only from these can proceed the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinations,&nbsp;</em>which are called his properties, and in which, too, his&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>is contained. Thus the philosophical [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">begreifende</em>] cognition of his&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">activity,</em>&nbsp;that is, of himself, grasps the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>of God in his&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>and his being in his Notion.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Being&nbsp;</em>merely as such, or even&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate being,&nbsp;</em>is such a meagre and restricted determination, that the difficulty of finding it in the Notion may well be the result of not having considered what being or determinate being itself is.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Being</em>&nbsp;as the wholly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract, immediate relation to self,&nbsp;</em>is nothing else than the abstract moment of the Notion, which moment is abstract universality. This universality also effects what one demands of being, namely, to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside</em>the Notion; for though this universality is moment of the Notion, it is equally the difference, or abstract judgment, of the Notion in which it opposes itself to itself.</p>

Yet if it is granted, as it commonly is, that the logical element as the formal element constitutes the form for the cognition of every determinate content, then the above relation must at least be conceded, unless in this opposition between Notion and objectivity, one stops short at the untrue Notion and an equally untrue reality, as something ultimate. But in the exposition&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of the pure Notion,&nbsp;</em>it was further made clear that this is the absolute, divine Notion itself, so that in truth the relationship of our&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">application&nbsp;</em>would not obtain, and the logical process in question would in fact be the immediate exposition of God&#39;s self-determination to being. But on this point it is to be remarked that if the Notion is to be presented as the Notion of God, it is to be apprehended as it is when taken up into the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Idea.&nbsp;</em>This pure Notion passes through the finite forms of the judgment and syllogism because it is not yet posited as in its own nature explicitly one with objectivity but is grasped only in process of becoming it. Similarly this objectivity, too, is not yet the divine existence, is not yet the reality that is reflected in the divine Idea. Yet objectivity is just that much richer and higher than the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being or existence&nbsp;</em>of the ontological proof, as the pure Notion is richer and higher than that metaphysical void of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum total of all reality.&nbsp;</em>But I reserve for another occasion the more detailed elucidation of the manifold misunderstanding that has been brought by logical formalism into the ontological, as well as the other, so-called proofs of God&#39;s existence, as also the Kantian criticism of them, and by establishing their true significance, to restore the fundamental thoughts of these proofs to their worth and dignity.</p>

In the sphere of being immediacy is being itself and determinate being; in the sphere of essence it is existence, and then actuality and substantiality; in the sphere of the Notion, besides immediacy as abstract universality, there is now objectivity. When the exactitude of philosophical distinctions of the Notion is not involved, these expressions may be used as synonymous; but the determinations mentioned have issued from the necessity of the Notion.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Being</em>&nbsp;is in general the first immediacy, and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate being&nbsp;</em>is the same&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plus&nbsp;</em>the first determinateness.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Existence,&nbsp;</em>along with things, is the immediacy that issues from the ground-from the self-sublating mediation of the simple reflection of essence. But&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actuality&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substantiality&nbsp;</em>is the immediacy that has issued from the sublated difference of the still unessential Existence as Appearance and its essentiality. Finally,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objectivity&nbsp;</em>is the immediacy to which the Notion determines itself by the sublation of its abstraction and mediation. Philosophy has the right to select from the language of common life which is made for the world of pictorial thinking, such expressions as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">seem to approximate&nbsp;</em>to the determinations of the Notion. There cannot be any question of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">demonstrating&nbsp;</em>for a word selected from the language of common life that in common life, too, one associates with it the same Notion for which philosophy employs it; for common life has no Notions, but only pictorial thoughts and general ideas, and to recognise the Notion in what is else a mere general idea is philosophy itself. It must suffice therefore if pictorial thinking, in the use of its expressions that are employed for philosophical determinations, has before it some vague idea of their distinctive meaning; just as it may be the case that in these expressions one recognises nuances of pictorial thought that are more closely related to the corresponding Notions. One will be less ready, perhaps, to admit that something can be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">without existing;&nbsp;</em>but at least, one will hardly use &#39;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being</em>&#39; as copula of the judgment as interchangeable with the expression &#39;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">to exist</em>&#39; and say, &#39;this article&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exists&nbsp;</em>dear, suitable, etc.&#39;, &#39;gold&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exists,&nbsp;</em>a metal or metallic&#39;, instead of &#39;this article&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>dear, suitable, etc.&#39;, &#39;gold&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>a metal or metallic&#39;.</p>

A similar twofold meaning also appears for objectivity which stands&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opposed&nbsp;</em>to the self-subsistent Notion, yet is also the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being that is in-and-for-itself.&nbsp;</em>In the former sense, the object stands opposed to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">I&nbsp;</em>=&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">I</em>&nbsp;which in subjective idealism is enunciated as the absolutely true; in that case it is the manifold world in its immediate existence with which the ego or the Notion only engages in never-ending struggle, in order, by the negation of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intrinsic nullity&nbsp;</em>of this other, to give to the first certainty of self the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actual truth&nbsp;</em>of its equality with itself.

Although rational, theoretical or ethical principles belong only to subjectivity, to consciousness, yet that element in the latter that is in and for itself is called objective; the cognition of truth is placed in cognising the object as object, free from anything added by subjective reflection, and right conduct in the obedience to objective laws that are not subjective in origin and admit no caprice and no treatment that might overthrow their necessity.</p>

Consequently this immediacy is itself immediately and wholly pervaded by the Notion, just as the Notion&#39;s totality is immediately identical with its being. But since, further, the Notion has equally to restore the free being-for-self of its subjectivity, there arises a relationship between the Notion as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">end&nbsp;</em>and objectivity. In this relationship the immediacy of the objectivity becomes the negative element over against the end, an element to be determined by the activity of the end; this immediacy thus acquires the other significance, that of being in and for itself null in so far as it stands opposed to the Notion.</p>

In the parts of a whole, there is indeed present that self-subsistence which belongs to the differences of the object, but these differences are themselves directly and essentially objects, totalities, that are not, like parts, determined as such in contrast to the whole.</p>

Consequently, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">explanation&nbsp;</em>of the determination of an object and the progressive determining of the object made for the purpose of the explanation, is only an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">empty word,&nbsp;</em>since in the other object to which it advances there resides no self-determination.</p>

In this determination they are the same thing as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">monads,&nbsp;</em>which for this very reason were thought of as exercising no influence whatever on one another. But the concept of a monad is, just for this reason, a defective reflection. For first it is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate&nbsp;</em>conception of the monad&#39;s merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicit</em>&nbsp;totality; as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">certain degree&nbsp;</em>of the development and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positedness of</em>&nbsp;its representation of the world, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate;&nbsp;</em>now while it is a self-enclosed totality, it is also indifferent to this determinateness; therefore the determinateness is not its own, but one that is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited by another&nbsp;</em>object. Secondly it is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>in general, in so far as it is supposed to be merely a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mirroring entity;&nbsp;</em>its relation to itself is therefore<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract universality;&nbsp;</em>hence it is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate being open to others.&nbsp;</em>To gain the freedom of substance it is not sufficient to represent it as a totality that is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">complete within itself&nbsp;</em>and has nothing to receive&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">from without.&nbsp;</em>On the contrary, the mechanical [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">begrifflose</em>], merely mirrored relation to itself is precisely a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">passivity&nbsp;</em>towards another. Similarly&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness,</em>&nbsp;whether taken as the determinateness of something that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is&nbsp;</em>or of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mirroring&nbsp;</em>entity, that is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">degree&nbsp;</em>of the monad&#39;s own spontaneous development, is something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external;&nbsp;</em>the degree that the development reaches has its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">limit&nbsp;</em>in an other. To shift the reciprocity of substances on to a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">predetermined harmony&nbsp;</em>means nothing more than to convert it into a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposition,&nbsp;</em>that is, to withdraw it from the Notion. The need to avoid the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">interaction&nbsp;</em>of substances was based on the moment of absolute&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistence and originality</em>&nbsp;which was made a fundamental assumption. But since the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positedness,&nbsp;</em>the degree of development, does not correspond to this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself,&nbsp;</em>it has for that very reason its ground in an other.</p>

But here what&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is,</em>&nbsp;no longer has the determination of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">substance,&nbsp;</em>but of an object; the causal relationship has been superseded in the Notion; the originality of one substance in relation to the other has shown itself to be illusory, its action to be transition into the opposed substance. This relationship therefore has no objectivity. Hence in so far as the one object is posited in the form of subjective unity as active cause, this no longer counts as an original determination but as something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediated;&nbsp;</em>the active object has this its determination only by means of another object.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Mechanism,&nbsp;</em>since it belongs to the sphere of the Notion, has that posited within it which proved to be the truth of the causal relationship, namely that the cause, which is supposed to be the original and self-subsistent factor is essentially effect, positedness, as well. In mechanism therefore the causality of the object is immediately a non-originality; it is indifferent to this its determination, therefore its being cause is for it something contingent. To this extent, one might indeed say that the causality of substances is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only a subjective conception.&nbsp;</em>But this causality as thus represented is precisely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mechanism</em>; for mechanism is this, that causality as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identical</em>determinateness of different substances and hence as the extinction of their self-subsistence in this identity, is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mere positedness;&nbsp;</em>the objects are indifferent to this unity and maintain themselves in face of it. But, no less is this their indifferent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistence&nbsp;</em>also a mere<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positedness;&nbsp;</em>they are therefore capable of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mixing and aggregating&nbsp;</em>and of becoming, as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">aggregate, one object.&nbsp;</em>Through this indifference both to their transition and to their self-subistence, substances are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objects</em>.</p>

The formal totality of the object in general, which is indifferent to the determinateness and hence is not a self-determination, makes it undistinguished from the other object and thus renders the interaction primarily an unimpeded continuation of the determinateness of the one in the other.</p>

They are not merely diverse, but are now&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specifically distinguished&nbsp;</em>as against one another. The result of the formal process which on the one hand is determinationless rest, is therefore, on the other hand, through the reflection into self of the determinateness, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">distribution of the opposition&nbsp;</em>which the object as such contains, among several objects standing in a mechanical relationship to one another. The object that on the one hand lacks all determination whatever and is neither<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">elastic nor self-subsistent&nbsp;</em>in its relationships, has on the other hand a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistence&nbsp;</em>that is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">impenetrable&nbsp;</em>to other objects. Objects now also have as against one another this more specific opposition of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistent individuality&nbsp;</em>and a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality that lacks self-subsistence.&nbsp;</em>The precise difference may be conceived as a merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative&nbsp;</em>one, as a difference of the magnitude of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mass&nbsp;</em>in the bodies, or as a difference of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intensity,&nbsp;</em>or in various other ways.

Imagine if you like someone quite dull-witted and ignoble, then on such a person lofty intelligence and nobility can make no impression. The only consistent defence&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">against&nbsp;</em>reason is to have no dealings with it at all. Where the object that is not self-subsistent cannot make contact with one that is and no communication can take place between them, the latter can also offer no&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">resistance,&nbsp;</em>that is, cannot specify the communicated universal for itself.

To make a few observations on this point: the fate of the living being is in general the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">genus,&nbsp;</em>which manifests itself through the perishableness of the living individuals, which in their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actual individuality&nbsp;</em>do not possess the genus as genus. As mere objects, merely animate natures, like all other things of a lower grade, have no fate; what befalls them is a contingency; but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in their Notion as objects</em>they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>to themselves; therefore the alien power of fate is nothing else but their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">own immediate nature,</em>&nbsp;externality and contingency itself. Only self-consciousness has a fate in the proper meaning of the word, because it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">is free</em>, and therefore in the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individuality&nbsp;</em>of its ego possesses a being that is absolutely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in and for itself&nbsp;</em>and can oppose itself to its objective universality and<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">estrange&nbsp;</em>itself from it. By this very separation, however, it excites against itself the mechanical relationship of a fate. In order therefore that this fate should be able to have power over it, it must have given itself some determinateness or other conflicting with the essential universality; it must have committed a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">deed.&nbsp;</em>By this, it has made itself into a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">particular,&nbsp;</em>and this existence as abstract universality, is at the same time the side open to the communication of its estranged essence; it is on this side that it is drawn into the process. The nation without deeds is without blame; it is wrapped in objective moral universality and dissolved in it and lacks that individuality which, while it moves the unmoved, and gives itself a determinateness outwards and an abstract universality separated from the objective universality, yet in so doing converts the subject into something estranged from its essence, into an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">object,&nbsp;</em>and brings it into the relationship of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality</em>&nbsp;towards its nature, into that of mechanism.</p>

Or in other words the previously non-self-subsistent, self-external objects are likewise by the regress of the Notion determined into individuals; the identity of the central body with itself which is still a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">striving</em>, is infected with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality</em>which, being taken up into the centra body&#39;s&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objective individuality,&nbsp;</em>has this latter determination communicated to it. Through this centrality of their own, these individuals placed outside that first centre, are themselves centres for the non-self-subsistent objects.

Again, these non-self-subsistent objects are the middle term of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">third</em>, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">formal syllogism,&nbsp;</em>in that they are the link between the absolute and the relative central individuality to the extent that the latter has in them its externality by virtue of which the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation-to-self&nbsp;</em>is at the same time&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a striving&nbsp;</em>towards an absolute centre. The formal objects have for their essence the identical&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">gravity&nbsp;</em>of their immediate central body in which they inhere as in their subject and the extreme of individuality; through the externality which they constitute, that body is subsumed under the absolute central body; they are, therefore, the formal middle term of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">particularity.&nbsp;</em>But the absolute individual is the objectively universal middle term which brings into unity and holds fast the being-within-self or inwardness of the relative individual and its externality. Similarly, too, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">government</em>, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individual citizens</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">needs</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external life</em>&nbsp;of the individuals, are three terms, each of which is the middle of the other two. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">government</em>&nbsp;is the absolute centre in which the extreme of the individuals is united with their external existence; similarly, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individuals</em>&nbsp;are the middle term that activate that universal individual into external concrete existence and translate their moral essence into the extreme of actuality. The third syllogism is the formal syllogism, that of an illusory show, in which the individuals purport to be linked to this universal absolute individuality by their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">needs&nbsp;</em>and external existence; a syllogism which, as merely subjective, passes over into the others and in them has its truth.</p>

Now the middle term whereby these extremes are concluded into a unity is first the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicit&nbsp;</em>nature of both, the whole Notion that holds both within itself. Secondly, however, since in their concrete existence they stand confronting each other, their absolute unity is also a still formal element having&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">an existence distinct</em>from them &mdash; the element of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">communication in</em>&nbsp;which they enter into external&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">community&nbsp;</em>with each other.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_729"></a>Since the real difference belongs to the extremes, this middle term is only the abstract neutrality, the real possibility of those extremes; it is, as it were, the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">theoretical element&nbsp;</em>of the concrete existence of chemical objects, of their process and its result. In the material world&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">water&nbsp;</em>fulfils the function of this medium; in the spiritual world, so far as the analogue of such a relation has a place there,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the sign&nbsp;</em>in general, and more precisely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">language,&nbsp;</em>is to be regarded as fulfilling that function.</p>

For the negative unity of the neutral product proceeds from a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposed&nbsp;</em>difference; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>of the chemical object is identical with its objectivity, it is original.

This disruption may in the first instance be regarded as the restoration of that opposition of the objects in tension with which chemism began. But this determination does not constitute the other extreme of the syllogism but belongs to the immediate relation of the differentiating principle to the middle term in which this principle gives itself its immediate reality; it is the determinateness that the middle term in the disjunctive syllogism also possesses besides being the universal nature of the object, and by virtue of which the object is both objective universality and also determinate particularity. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other extreme&nbsp;</em>of the syllogism stands opposed to the external&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-subsistent extreme&nbsp;</em>of individuality; it is therefore the equally self-subsistent extreme of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality;&nbsp;</em>hence the disruption suffered by the real neutrality of the middle term in this extreme is that it is split up into moments whose relationship is not that of difference, but of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifference.&nbsp;</em>Accordingly these moments are the abstract indifferent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">base&nbsp;</em>on the one side, and its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">energising</em>principle on the other, which latter by its separation from the base attains likewise the form of indifferent objectivity.</p>

What happens here is that the object does not relate itself to another in accordance with an immediate, one-sided determinateness, but that in accordance with the inner totality of an original&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation it posits the presupposition</em>which it requires for a real relation and thereby gives itself a middle term through which it unites its Notion with its reality; it is absolutely determined individuality, the concrete Notion as principle of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">disjunction into extremes whose re-union</em>&nbsp;is the activity of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the same&nbsp;</em>negative principle, which thereby returns to its first determination, but returns&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objectified</em>.</p>

Consequently it is not yet for itself that totality of self-determination that proceeds from it and in which rather it is sublated. The three syllogisms yielded by the foregoing exposition constitute its totality; the first has for middle term formal neutrality and for extremes the objects in tension; the second has for middle term the product of the first, real neutrality, and for extremes the sundering activity and its product, the indifferent element; while the third is the self-realising Notion, which posits for itself the presupposition by which the process of its realisation is conditioned &mdash; a syllogism that has the universal for its essence. On account, however, of the immediacy and externality attaching to chemical objectivity,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">these syllogisms still fall apart.&nbsp;</em>The first process whose product is the neutrality of the objects in tension is extinguished in its product, and it is an externally applied differentiation that re-kindles it; conditioned by an immediate presupposition, it exhausts itself in it. Similarly, the separation of the [chemically] different extremes out of the neutral product, as also their decomposition into their abstract elements, must proceed from&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">conditions&nbsp;</em>and stimulations of activity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externally brought into play.&nbsp;</em>Also, although the two essential moments of the process, on the one side neutralisation, on the other separation and reduction, are combined in one and the same process, and the union of the extremes by weakening of the tension between them is also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a sundering&nbsp;</em>into such extremes, yet on account of the still underlying externality they constitute&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">two different&nbsp;</em>sides; the extremes that are separated in that same process are different objects or materials from those that unite in it; in so far as the former emerge again from the process as [chemically] different they must turn outwards; their new neutralisation is a different process from the neutralisation that took place in the first process.</p>

In the first process, the mutual externality of the different extremes that constitute the whole reality, or the distinction between the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly</em>determinate Notion and its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existent&nbsp;</em>determinateness, is sublated; in the second, the externality of the real unity, the union as merely<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">neutral,&nbsp;</em>is sublated; more precisely, the formal activity in the first instance sublates itself in equally formal bases or indifferent determinatenesses, whose&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inner Notion</em>&nbsp;is now the indrawn absolute activity as inwardly self-realising, that is, the activity that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posits</em>the determinate differences within itself and through this mediation constitutes itself as real unity &mdash; a mediation which is thus the Notion&#39;s own mediation, its self-determination, and in respect of its reflection thence into itself, an immanent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposing.&nbsp;</em>The third syllogism, which on the one hand is the restoration of the preceding processes, on the other hand sublates the last remaining moment of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifferent&nbsp;</em>bases the wholly abstract external&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediacy,&nbsp;</em>which in this way becomes the Notion&#39;s own moment of self-mediation.

Just as the subjective understanding also exhibits errors in itself, so the objective world also exhibits aspects and stages of truth that by themselves are still one-sided, incomplete and only relationships in the sphere of Appearance. If mechanism and purposiveness stand opposed to one another, they cannot for that very reason be taken as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifferent&nbsp;</em>concepts, each of which is correct on its own account, possessing as much validity as the other, the only question being where one or the other may be applied. This equal validity of both rests merely on the fact that they&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">are,&nbsp;</em>that is to say, that we&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">have&nbsp;</em>them both. But since they are opposed, the necessary preliminary question is, which of the two is the true one; and the higher and real question is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">whether their truth is not a third concept, or whether one of them is the truth of the other.&nbsp;</em><a name="HL3_735"></a>But the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation of end</em>&nbsp;has proved to be the truth of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mechanism</em>&nbsp;&mdash; what exhibited itself as chemism is included with mechanism in so far as end is the Notion in free Existence; and to end stands opposed in general the unfreedom of the Notion, its submergence in externality;&nbsp;<span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">both of them, therefore, mechanism and chemism, are included under natural necessity</span>; for in the former the Notion does not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exist</em>&nbsp;in the object. Since the object as mechanical does not contain self-determination, while in chemism the Notion either has a one-sided Existence in a state of tension, or, in emerging as the unity that disjoins the neutral object into tensed extremes, is external to itself in so far as it sublates this disjunction.</p>

Of course mechanism, at least the ordinary unfree mechanism, and also chemism must be regarded as an immanent principle in so far as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>determinant is itself&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">again just such another&nbsp;</em>object, externally determined and indifferent to such determining, or, in the case of chemism, the other object is one likewise chemically determined; in general, an essential moment of the totality always lies in something outside it. These principles therefore remain confined within the same natural form of finitude; yet though they do not seek to go beyond the finite and lead only to finite causes in their explanation of phenomena, which themselves demand a further progress, at the same time they expand themselves, partly into a formal totality in the concept of force, cause, and similar determinations of reflection which are supposed to denote a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">primariness,</em>and partly also through the abstract&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality&nbsp;</em>of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sum total&nbsp;</em>of forces, a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">whole&nbsp;</em>of reciprocal causes. Mechanism shows itself to be a striving for totality in the fact that it seeks to grasp nature&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">by itself&nbsp;</em>as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">whole&nbsp;</em>that for&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its Notion&nbsp;</em>does not require any other &mdash; a totality that is not found in end and the extra-mundane intelligence associated with it.</p>

In teleology, on the contrary, the content becomes important, for teleology presupposes a Notion, something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolutely determined&nbsp;</em>and therefore self-determining, and so has made a distinction between the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation</em>&nbsp;of the differences and their reciprocal determinedness, that is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form,&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity that is reflected into itself, a unity that is determined in and for itself&nbsp;</em>and therefore&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a content.&nbsp;</em>But when the content is otherwise a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finite&nbsp;</em>and insignificant one, it contradicts what it is supposed to be; for end, according to its form, is a totality&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite within&nbsp;</em>itself-especially when the activity that operates in accordance with ends is assumed to be an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absolute&nbsp;</em>will and intelligence. The reason why teleology has incurred so much the reproach of triviality is that the ends that it exhibited are more important or more trivial, as the case may be; and it was inevitable that the end relation of objects should so often appear trifling, since it appears to be so external and therefore contingent. Mechanism, on the contrary, leaves to the determinatenesses of objects, as regards their import, their contingent status, to which the object is indifferent, and these determinatenesses are not supposed to have, either for the objects or for the subjective intelligence, any higher validity. This principle, therefore, in its context of external necessity gives the consciousness of infinite freedom as compared with teleology, which sets up for something absolute what is trivial and even contemptible in its content, in which the more universal thought can only find itself infinitely cramped and even feel disgusted.</p>

The Notion being thus posited as something formal, then for such teleology the content is also something that for the Notion is given externally in the manifoldness of the objective world &mdash; in those very determinatenesses which are also the content of mechanism, but appearing there as something external and contingent. On account of this community of content, it is solely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form of purposiveness&nbsp;</em>by itself that constitutes what is essential in this teleology. In this respect, without as yet attending to the difference of outer and inner purposiveness, the end-relation in general has proved itself to be in and for itself the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">truth of mechanism.&nbsp;</em>Teleology possesses in general the higher principle, the Notion in its Existence, which is in and for itself the infinite and absolute-a principle of freedom that in the utter certainty of its self-determination is absolutely liberated from the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external determining&nbsp;</em>of mechanism.</p>

Kant has exhibited the opposition in this form among the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">antinomies</em>&nbsp;of reason, namely, as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">third conflict of the transcendental ideas</em></span>. His exposition, which was referred to earlier, I cite quite briefly, as the gist of it is so simple as to require no detailed analysis, and the peculiar features of the Kantian antinomies have been elucidated in more detail elsewhere.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">antithesis</em>&nbsp;is: There is no freedom, but everything in the world happens solely according to natural laws.</p>

The whole roundabout method of proof could therefore be spared; the proof consists in nothing but the assertorical affirmation of the two opposed propositions.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">Thus in order to prove the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thesis</em>&nbsp;we have first to assume that there is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">no other causality</em>&nbsp;than that according to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">natural laws</em>, that is, according to the necessity of mechanism in general, including chemism. This proposition w e find to be selfcontradictory, because we take natural law to consist just in this, that nothing happens without a cause sufficiently determined&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a priori</em>, which cause therefore must contain an absolute spontaneity within itself; that is, the assumption opposed to the thesis is contradictory because it contradicts the thesis.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">In order to prove the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">antithesis</em>, we are to postulate that there exists a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">freedom</em>, as a particular kind of causality, that absolutely initiates a state of things and therefore also a series of consequences of that state.

End, on the contrary, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete universal</em>, which possesses in its own self the moment of particularity and externality and is therefore active and the urge to repel itself from itself. The Notion, as end, is of course an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objective judgment</em>&nbsp;in which one determination, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subject</em>, namely the concrete Notion, is self-determined, while the other is not merely a predicate but external objectivity. But the end relation is not for that reason a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reflective</em>&nbsp;judging that considers external objects only according to a unity,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as though</em>&nbsp;an intelligence had given this unity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for the convenience of our cognitive faculty</em>; on the contrary it is the absolute truth that judges&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objectively</em>&nbsp;and determines external objectivity absolutely.

End therefore is the subjective Notion as an essential effort and urge to posit itself externally. In this process it is exempt from transition. It is neither a force expressing itself nor a substance and cause manifesting itself in accidents and effects. Force that has not expressed itself is only an abstract inner; that is, it is only in its expression, to which it must be solicited, that it has a determinate being.</p>

End may indeed also be defined as force and cause, but these expressions fulfil only an incomplete side of its significance; if they are to be predicated of it as it truly is, they can be predicated only in a way that sublates their Notion: as a force that solicits itself to expression, as a cause that is cause of itself, or whose effect is immediately cause.</p>

This negative attitude towards the object is just as much a negative attitude towards itself, a sublating of the subjectivity of the end. Positively, it is the realisation of the end, namely, the union of objective being with it, so that this being, which, as a moment of the end is immediately the determinateness identical with it, shall appear as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>determinateness, and conversely the objective as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposition&nbsp;</em>shall instead be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>as determined by the Notion. End is in its own self the urge to realise itself; the determinateness of the moments of the Notion is externality; but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">their simplicity&nbsp;</em>in the unity of the Notion is inadequate to the nature of this unity, and the Notion therefore repels itself from itself. This repulsion is in general the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">resolution&nbsp;</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Entschluss</em>] of the relation of the negative unity to itself, whereby it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exclusive</em>&nbsp;individuality; but by this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exclusion</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Ausschliessen</em>]<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&nbsp;it resolves itself</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sich entschliesst</em>] or&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">opens up itself&nbsp;</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">schliesst sich auf</em>], because this exclusion is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-determining,&nbsp;</em>as positing of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its own self.&nbsp;</em>On the one hand subjectivity in determining itself makes itself into particularity, gives itself a content which, enclosed within the unity of the Notion, is still an inner one; but this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positing,&nbsp;</em>the simple reflection-into-self, is immediately, as we have seen, also a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposing;&nbsp;</em>and in the same moment in which the subject of the end determines&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">itself,&nbsp;</em>it is related to an indifferent, external objectivity which is to be equated by it with the said inner determinateness, that is to say, is to be posited as something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determined by the Notion,&nbsp;</em>and in the first instance as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">means.</em></p>

The absolute Notion possesses mediation within itself in such a manner that its first positing is not a presupposing whose object would have indifferent externality for its fundamental determination; on the contrary, the world as a creation has only the form of such externality, but its fundamental determination is really constituted by its negativity and positedness. The finitude of end consists accordingly in this, that its determining is altogether external to itself, and so its first determining, as we have seen, divides itself into a positing and a presupposing; therefore the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation&nbsp;</em>of this determining, too, is so far only in one aspect already a reflection-into-self; in the other, it is in fact merely a first negation; in other words the very reflection-into-self is also external to itself and a reflection outwards.</p>

Further, just as this particularity is middle term only by being determinateness in relation to one extreme and a universal in relation to the other, and therefore owes its mediating determination to its relation to other terms, so the means, too, is only the mediating middle term, first because it is an immediate object, secondly because it is a means by virtue of the relation it possesses<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externally&nbsp;</em>to the extreme of the end &mdash; a relation that is for it a form to which it is indifferent.</p>

By virtue of this determination of end present in the means, the latter is now also subsumptive in relation to the other extreme of the initially still indeterminate objectivity. Conversely, in contrast to the subjective end, the means, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate objectivity,&nbsp;</em>has a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality of existence</em>&nbsp;that the subjective individuality of the end still lacks. The end being thus in the first instance only an external determinateness in the means, it is itself, as a negative unity, outside it; just as the means is a mechanical object that possesses the end only as a determinateness, not as simple concretion of the totality. As the unifying element, however, the middle term must itself be the totality of the end. It has been seen that the determination of end in the means is at the same time reflection-into-self; it is in so far formal self-relation, since the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness, as real indifference,</em>&nbsp;is posited as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objectivity&nbsp;</em>of the means. But for this very reason, this, in one respect, pure subjectivity, is at the same time also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">activity.&nbsp;</em>In the subjective end the negative relation-to-self is still identical with determinateness as such, with content and externality. But in the incipient objectification of the end, in the becoming-other of the simple Notion, these moments separate themselves, or conversely, it is in such separation that this becoming-other or externality consists.</p>

But further,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality&nbsp;</em>is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>of the activity of the end and the means. The means is an object,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>the totality of the Notion; it has no power of resistance against the end, as it has in the first instance against another immediate object. To the end, therefore, which is the posited Notion, it is absolutely penetrable, and receptive of this communication, because it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>&nbsp;identical with the end. But now it is also&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>as penetrable by the Notion, for in centrality it is an object striving towards the negative unity; similarly in chemism, it is as a neutral and also as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">different&nbsp;</em>object, no longer self-subsistent. Its lack of self-subsistence consists precisely in its being only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself&nbsp;</em>the totality of the Notion; but the latter is a being-for-self. Consequently the object has the character of being powerless against the end and of serving it; the end is the object&#39;s subjectivity or soul, that has in the object its external side.</p>

The activity of the end through the means is for that reason still directed against this presupposition, and the end is activity and no longer merely an urge and a striving, precisely because the moment of objectivity is posited in the means in its determinateness as something external, and the simple unity of the Notion now has this objectivity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as such&nbsp;</em>in itself.</p>

The activity of the end through its means is still directed against objectivity as an original presupposition; the nature of this activity is precisely this, to be indifferent to the determinateness. Were the activity again to consist in merely determining the immediate objectivity, the product would again be merely a means, and so on to infinity; the outcome would be only a means suitable to the end, but not the objectivity of the end itself. Therefore the end which is active in its means, in determining the immediate object must not do so&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as a determinant external to it,&nbsp;</em>and consequently the object must spontaneously conform to the unity of the Notion; in other words, the former external activity of the end through its means must determine itself as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediation&nbsp;</em>and sublate its own self.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">The relation of the activity of the end through the means to the external object is in the first instance the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">second&nbsp;</em>premise of the syllogism &mdash; an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>relation of the middle term to the other extreme. It is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>because the middle term has an external object in it and the other extreme is another such object. The means is effective and potent against the latter because its own object is connected with the self-determining activity, while for the other object the immediate determinateness that it possesses is an indifferent one. Their process in this relation is none other than the mechanical or chemical one; in this objective externality the previous relationships emerge but under the dominance of the end. These processes, however, as they themselves showed, spontaneously return into the end. If, therefore, in the first instance, the relation of the means to the external object it has to work upon is an immediate one, it has already at an earlier stage exhibited itself as a syllogism, the end having proved itself to be their true middle term and unity. As, therefore, the means is the object that stands on the side of the end and has within it the activity of the end, the mechanism that is found here is at the same time the return of objectivity into itself, into the Notion, which however is already presupposed as the end; the negative attitude of purposive activity towards the object is thus not an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external</em>&nbsp;attitude, but the alteration and transition of objectivity in its own self into the end.</p>

But that the end posits itself in a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediate&nbsp;</em>relation with the object and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">interposes</em>&nbsp;another object&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">between&nbsp;</em>itself and it, may be regarded as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">cunning</em>&nbsp;of reason. The finitude of rationality has, as remarked, this side, that the end enters into relationship with the presupposition, that is, with the externality of the object. In the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate relation&nbsp;</em>to the object, it would itself enter into the sphere of mechanism or chemism and thereby be subject to contingency and the loss of its determination as the Notion that is in and for itself. But as it is, it puts forward an object as means, allows it to wear itself out in its stead, exposes it to attrition and shields itself behind it from mechanical violence.</p>

The end, as the Notion that freely exists in face of the object and its process and is a self-determining activity, is no less the absolute truth of mechanism, and therefore in mechanism it is only meeting with itself. The power of the end over the object is this explicit identity and its activity is the manifestation of it. The end as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content</em>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness</em>&nbsp;that exists in and for itself, which appears in the object as indifferent and external; but the activity of the end is, on the one hand, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">truth</em>&nbsp;of the process and as negative unity the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sublating of the illusory show of externality</em>. From the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract</em>&nbsp;point of view, it is the indifferent determinateness of the object that equally externally is replaced by another; but the simple&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstraction</em>&nbsp;of the determinateness is in its truth the totality of the negative, the concrete Notion that posits externality within itself.</p>

On account of this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simplicity</em>&nbsp;whose determinateness is in and for itself the totality of the Notion, the content appears as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">permanently identical</em>element in the realisation of the end.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_747a"></a><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">The teleological process is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">translation</em>&nbsp;of the Notion that has a distinct concrete existence as Notion into objectivity</span>; this translation into a presupposed other is seen to be the meeting of the Notion&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with itself through itself</em>.&nbsp;</p>

In every transition the Notion maintains itself; for example, when cause becomes effect it is only the cause meeting with itself in the effect; but in the teleological transition it is the Notion that as such already has a concrete existence&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as cause,&nbsp;</em>as the absolute concrete unity that is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">free&nbsp;</em>in the face of objectivity and its external determinability. The externality into which the end translates itself is itself, as we have seen, already posited as moment of the Notion, as form of its immanent differentiation. The end possesses, therefore, in externality&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its own moment;&nbsp;</em>and the content, as content of the concrete unity, is its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple form,&nbsp;</em>which not merely remains&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicitly&nbsp;</em>self-identical in the distinct moments of the end &mdash; as subjective end, as means and mediating activity, and as objective end &mdash; but also has a concrete existence as the abiding self-identical.</p>

A determinateness of this kind, which an object possesses through the end, differs in general from another merely mechanical one by the fact that the former is moment of a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity,&nbsp;</em>so that although the determinateness is indeed external to the object, yet it is not in its own self something merely external. The object that exhibits such a unity is a whole, towards which its parts, its own externality, is indifferent; a determinate&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete&nbsp;</em>unity which unites within itself distinct relations and determinatenesses. This unity which cannot be comprehended from the specific nature of the object, and as regards determinate content is another content than that peculiar to the object, is not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">by itself&nbsp;</em>a mechanical determinateness, but it is still mechanically related to the object. Just as in this product of the purposive activity the content of the end and the content of the object are external to each other, so a like relation holds between the determinations of this activity in the other moments of the syllogism &mdash; in the unifying middle term, between the purposive activity and the object which is means, and in the subjective end, the other extreme, between the infinite form as totality of the Notion and its content. According to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation&nbsp;</em>by which the subjective end is united with objectivity, both premises alike &mdash; the relation of the object determined as means to the still external object, and the relation of the subjective end to the object which is made means &mdash; are immediate relations. The syllogism therefore suffers from the defect of the formal syllogism in general, that the relations of which it consists, are not themselves conclusions or mediations, but in fact already presuppose the conclusion for whose production they are supposed to serve as means.</p>

Thus there is posited the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinite progress of mediation.&nbsp;</em>The same thing takes place in respect of the other premise, the relation of the means to the as yet undetermined object. Since they are absolutely self-subsistent, they can only be united in a third, and so on to infinity. Or conversely, since the premises already presuppose the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">conclusion,&nbsp;</em>the conclusion, being based on these merely immediate premises, can only be imperfect. The conclusion or the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">product</em>&nbsp;of the purposive act is nothing but an object determined by an end external to it;&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">consequently it is the same thing as the means</em>.

All objects, therefore, in which an external end is realised, are equally only a means of the end. Whatever is intended to be used for realising an end and to be taken essentially as means, is a means which, in accordance with its destiny, is to be destroyed. But the object that is supposed to contain the realised end, and to represent the objectivity of the end, is also perishable; it too fulfils its end not by a tranquil existence in which it preserves itself, but only in so far as it is worn away; for only thus does it conform to the unity of the Notion, in that its externality, that is, its objectivity, sublates itself in that unity. A house, a clock, may appear as ends in relation to the tools employed for their production; but the stones and beams, or wheels and axles, and so on, which constitute the actuality of the end fulfil that end only through the pressure that they suffer, through the chemical processes with air, light, and water to which they are exposed and that deprive man of them by their friction and so forth. Accordingly, they fulfil their destiny only by being used and worn away and they correspond to what they are supposed to be only through their negation. They are not positively united with the end, because they possess self-determination only externally and are only relative ends, or essentially nothing but means.</p>

The externality of the object, self-subsistent as against the Notion, which the end presupposes for itself is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited&nbsp;</em>in this presupposition as an unessential illusory show and is also already sublated in and for itself; the activity of the end is therefore, strictly speaking, only the representation of this illusory show and the sublating of it. As the Notion has shown us, the first object becomes by communication a means, because it is in itself totality of the Notion, and its determinateness which is none other than externality itself is posited merely as something external and unessential and therefore appears within the end itself as the end&#39;s own moment not as a self-subsistent moment relatively to the end. Thus the determination of the object as a means is purely an immediate one. Accordingly, in order to make that object a means, the subjective end requires to use no violence against the object, no reinforcement against it other than the reinforcing of itself; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">resolve&nbsp;</em>[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Entschluss</em>], the explication [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Aufschluss</em>], this determination of itself, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">merely posited&nbsp;</em>externality of the object, which appears therein as immediately subjected to the end and possesses no other determination counter to it than that of the nullity of the being-in-and-for-self.</p>

In this way, the negativity returns into it self in such a manner that it is equally a restoration of the objectivity but of an objectivity identical with it, and in this it is as at the same time also a positing of the objectivity as an external objectivity determined only by the end. Through the latter circumstance this product remains as before also a means; through the former it is objectivity that is identical with the Notion, the realised end, in which the side of being a means is the reality of the end itself. In the realised end the means vanishes, for it would be the objectivity that is as yet only immediately subsumed under the end, and in the realised end objectivity is present as the return of the end into itself; further, with it there also vanishes the mediation itself as a relation of something external, on the one side, into the concrete identity of the objective end, and on the other, into the same identity as abstract identity and immediacy of existence.</p>

The realised end is also means, and conversely the truth of the means is just this, to be itself a real end, and the first sublating of objectivity is already also the second, just as the second proved to contain the first, as well. That is to say, the Notion&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determines itself;&nbsp;</em>its determinateness is external indifference, which is immediately determined in the resolution [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Entschluss</em>]<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">&nbsp;as sublated,</em>&nbsp;namely as<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">internal, subjective&nbsp;</em>indifference, and at the same time as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposed object.&nbsp;</em>Its further passage out from itself which appeared, namely, as an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>communication and subsumption of the presupposed object under it, is at the same time a sublating of the former determinateness of externality that was internal and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">enclosed within the Notion,&nbsp;</em>that is, posited as sublated, and at the same time a sublating of the presupposition of an object; consequently, this apparently first sublating of the indifferent objectivity is already the second as well, a reflection-into-self that has passed through mediation, and the realised end.</p>

In the Notion taken by itself, that is in its subjectivity, its difference from itself appears as an<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>identical totality on its own account; but since its determinateness here is indifferent externality, its identity with itself in this externality is also immediately again self-repulsion, so that what is determined as external and indifferent to the identity is the identity itself; and the identity as identity, as reflected into itself, is rather its other. Only by keeping this firmly in mind can we grasp the objective return of the Notion into itself, that is, the true objectification of the Notion &mdash; grasp that each of the single moments through which this mediation runs its course is itself the entire syllogism of those moments.</p>

Of the second relation, the determination of the object as means, it has just been shown how it is within itself the mediation of the end in the object with itself. Similarly, the third relation, mechanism, which proceeds under the dominance of the end and sublates the object by the object, is on the one hand a sublating of the means, of the object already posited as sublated and is therefore a second sublating and a reflection-into-self; while on the other hand it is a first determining of the external object. The latter, as has been remarked, is the production again in the realised end only of a means; the subjectivity of the finite Notion, contemptuously rejecting the means, has attained to nothing better in its goal. But this reflection that the end is reached in the means, and that in the fulfilled end, means and mediation are preserved, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">last result of the external end-relation,&nbsp;</em>a result in which that relation has sublated itself, and which it has exhibited as its truth. The third syllogism that was considered last is distinguished by the fact that it is, in the first place, the subjective purposive activity of the preceding syllogisms, but is also the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">spontaneous&nbsp;</em>sublation of external objectivity, and therewith of externality in general, and hence is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the totality in its positedness.</em></p>

That the Idea has not completely leavened its reality, has imperfectly subdued it to the Notion, this is a possibility arising from the fact that the Idea itself has a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">restricted content</em>, that though it is essentially the unity of Notion and reality, it is no less essentially their difference; for only the object is their immediate, that is, merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicit</em>&nbsp;unity. But if an object, for example the state,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">did not correspond at all</em>&nbsp;to its Idea, that is, if in fact it was not the Idea of the state at all, if its reality, which is the self-conscious individuals, did not correspond at all to the Notion, its soul and its body would have parted; the former would escape into the solitary regions of thought, the latter would have broken up into the single individualities.</p>

The worst state, one whose reality least corresponds to the Notion, in so far as it still exists, is still Idea; the individuals still obey a dominant Notion.</p>

That is to say, the Notion as such is itself already the identity of itself and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reality</em>; for the indefinite expression &#39;reality&#39; means in general nothing else but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate being</em>, and this the Notion possesses in its particularity and individuality. Similarly too,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objectivity</em>&nbsp;is the total&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion</em>&nbsp;that out of its determinateness has withdrawn into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identity</em>with itself. In the former subjectivity the determinateness or difference of the Notion is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">illusory being</em>&nbsp;[semblance] that is immediately sublated and has withdrawn into being-for-self or negative unity; it is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inhering</em>&nbsp;predicate. But in this objectivity the determinateness is posited as an immediate totality, as an external whole. Now the Idea has shown itself to be the Notion liberated again into its subjectivity from the immediacy in which it is submerged in the object; to he the Notion that distinguishes itself from its objectivity, which however is no less determined by it and possesses its substantiality only in that Notion. &#39;This identity has therefore rightly been defined as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subject-object</em>, for it is as well the formal or subjective Notion as it is the object as such. But this must be understood more precisely. The Notion, having truly attained its reality, is this absolute judgment whose&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subject</em>, as self-related negative unity, distinguishes itself from its objectivity and is the latter&#39;s being-in-and-for-self, but essentially relates itself to it through itself; it is therefore its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">own end</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">urge</em>&nbsp;to realise it; but for this very reason the subject does not possess objectivity in an immediate manner, for if it did it would be merely the totality of the object as such lost in objectivity; on the contrary, objectivity is the realisation of the end, an objectivity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited</em>&nbsp;by the activity of the end, an objectivity which, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positedness</em>, possesses its subsistence and its form only as permeated by its subject. As objectivity, it has in it the moment of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality</em>&nbsp;of the Notion and is therefore in general the side of finitude, change and Appearance, a side, however, which meets with extinction in its retraction into the negative unity of the Notion; the negativity whereby its indifferent mutual externality exhibits itself as unessential and a positivity, is the Notion itself.</p>

But this Idea has come upon the scene through the Notion&#39;s own necessity; the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Idea,&nbsp;</em>that which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">true&nbsp;</em>in and for itself, is essentially the subject matter of logic; since it is at first to be considered in its immediacy, it must be apprehended and cognised in this determinateness in which it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">life,&nbsp;</em>in order that its treatment shall not be an empty affair devoid of determinate content. All that we need perhaps to remark is how far the logical view of life differs from any other scientific view of it; this is not the place, however, to concern ourselves with how life is treated in the unphilosophical sciences, but only with differentiating logical life as pure Idea from natural life which is dealt with in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">philosophy of nature,&nbsp;</em>and from life in so far as it stands in connection with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">spirit.&nbsp;</em>The former of these, as the life of nature, is life as projected into the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">externality of existence&nbsp;</em>and having its<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">condition&nbsp;</em>in inorganic nature, and where the moments of the Idea are a multiplicity of actual formations. Life in the Idea is without such<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presuppositions&nbsp;</em>which are in the form of shapes of actuality; its presupposition is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>as we have considered it, on the one hand as subjective, on the other hand as objective. In nature life appears as the highest stage, a stage that nature&#39;s externality attains by withdrawing into itself and sublating itself in subjectivity. In Logic it is simple inwardness [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Insichsein</em>], which in the Idea of life has attained an externality that genuinely corresponds to it; the Notion that earlier appeared on the scene as subjective Notion is the soul of life itself; it is the urge that mediates for itself its reality throughout objectivity. Nature, having reached this Idea from the starting point of its externality, transcends itself; its end does not appear as its beginning, but as its limit, in which it sublates itself. Similarly, in the Idea of life the moments of its reality do not receive the shape of external actuality but remain enclosed within the form of the Notion.</p>

What is distinguished as part, or in accordance with some other external reflection, has within itself the whole Notion; the Notion is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">omnipresent&nbsp;</em>soul in it, which remains simple self-relation and remains a one in the multiplicity belonging to objective being. This multiplicity, as self-external objectivity, has an indifferent subsistence, which in space and time, if these could already be mentioned here, is a mutual externality of wholly diverse and self-subsistent elements. But in life externality is at the same time present as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple determinateness&nbsp;</em>of its Notion; thus the soul is an omnipresent outpouring of itself into this multiplicity and at the same remains absolutely the simple oneness of the concrete Notion with itself. The thinking that clings to the determinations of the relationships of reflection and of the formal Notion, when it comes to consider life, this unity of its Notion in the externality of objectivity, in the absolute multiplicity of atomistic matter, finds all its thoughts without exception are of no avail; the omnipresence of the simple in manifold externality is for reflection an absolute contradiction, and as reflection must at the same time apprehend this omnipresence from its perception of life and therefore admit the actuality of this Idea, it is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">incomprehensible mystery&nbsp;</em>for it, because it does not grasp the Notion, and the Notion as the substance of life. This simple life, however, is not only omnipresent; it is absolutely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subsistence and immanent substance&nbsp;</em>of its objectivity; but as subjective substance it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">urge,&nbsp;</em>and moreover the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">specific urge,&nbsp;</em>of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">particular&nbsp;</em>difference, and no less essentially the one and universal urge of the specialised difference that reduces this its particularisation into unity and maintains it therein. It is only as this<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative unity&nbsp;</em>of its objectivity and particularisation that life is a self-related life that is for itself, a soul. As such it is essentially an individual, which relates itself to objectivity as to an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other,&nbsp;</em>to a non-living nature.</p>

One extreme is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">unity&nbsp;</em>of the Notion and reality, which is the Idea, as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>unity that at an earlier stage appeared as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">objectivity.&nbsp;</em>But here it is in a different determination. There it was the unity of Notion and reality, where the Notion has passed over into the reality in which it is merely lost; it did not stand over against the reality, or in other words, because the Notion is for the reality only an inner, it is merely a reflection&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">external&nbsp;</em>to it. That objectivity is therefore the immediate itself in an immediate form. Here, on the contrary, it has proceeded only from the Notion, so that its essence is positedness, and it exists as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative.&nbsp;</em>It is to be regarded as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">side of the universality of the Notion,&nbsp;</em>consequently as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract&nbsp;</em>universality, essentially only<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inhering&nbsp;</em>in the subject and in the form of immediate&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>which, posited on its own account, is indifferent to the subject. Thus the totality of the Notion which attaches to the objectivity is, as it were, only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">lent&nbsp;</em>to it; the last self-subsistence that objectivity possesses as against the subject is this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being&nbsp;</em>which, in its truth, is only the above moment of the Notion, the Notion that, as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposing,&nbsp;</em>is in the first determinateness of an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicit&nbsp;</em>positing, which does not yet exist&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as&nbsp;</em>a positing, as the unity that is reflected into itself. Self-subsistent objectivity, therefore, having proceeded from the Idea, is immediate being only as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">predicate&nbsp;</em>of the judgement of the Notion&#39;s self-determination &mdash; a being that is indeed distinct from the subject, but at the same time is essentially posited as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">moment&nbsp;</em>of the Notion.</p>

Above, in the syllogism of external purposiveness, we considered its first premise, namely that the end relates itself immediately to objectivity and makes it a means, and we found that in this premise the end does indeed remain similar to itself and has withdrawn into itself in the objectivity, but that the objectivity has not yet&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own self</em>&nbsp;sublated itself, and therefore the end is to that extent not yet&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in and for itself&nbsp;</em>in this premise, and only becomes so in the conclusion. The process of the living being with itself is this same premise, but in so far as the latter is also conclusion, and in so far as the immediate relation of the subject to objectivity, which objectivity thereby becomes a means and instrument, is at the same time the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative unity&nbsp;</em>of the Notion in its own self; the end realises itself in this its externality by being the subjective power over that externality and the process in which the externality displays its self-dissolution and its return into this the negative unity of the end. The restlessness and mutability of the external side of the living being is the manifestation in it of the Notion, which as in its own self negativity only has an objectivity in so far as the latter&#39;s indifferent subsistence reveals itself as self-sublating. The Notion therefore produces itself by its urge in such a manner that the product, the Notion being its essence, is itself the producing agent; that is to say the product is product only as the externality that equally posits itself as negative, or is product only in being the process of production.</p>

The reflection-into-self sublates this immediacy &mdash; on the one side as a theoretical reflection, that is, in so far as the negativity is present as the simple moment of sensibility that was considered in the latter and which constitutes feeling &mdash; on the other side as real reflection, in that the unity of the Notion posits itself&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its external objectivity&nbsp;</em>as negative unity; this is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reproduction</em>. The first two moments, sensibility and irritability, are abstract determinations; in reproduction life is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete&nbsp;</em>and is vitality; in it, as in its truth, life for the first time has also feeling and the power of resistance. Reproduction is the negativity as simple moment of sensibility, and irritability is only a living power of resistance, so that the relationship to the external is reproduction and individual identity with self. Each of the individual moments is essentially the totality of all; their difference constitutes the ideal form determinateness, which is posited in reproduction as concrete totality of the whole. This whole is, therefore, on the one hand opposed as a third, namely as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">real&nbsp;</em>totality, to the former determinate totalities, while on the other hand it is their implicit essential nature, and at the same time that in which they are embraced as moments, and in which they have their subject and their subsistence.</p>

The subject is its own end [<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Selbstzweck</em>], the Notion, which has its means and subjective reality in the objectivity that is subjugated to it. As such, it is constituted as the Idea in and for itself and as a being that is essentially self-subsistent, in face of which the presupposed external world has the value only of something negative and lacking self-subsistence. In its self-feeling the living being has this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">certainty&nbsp;</em>of the intrinsic nullity of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">otherness&nbsp;</em>confronting it. Its urge is the need to sublate this otherness and to give itself the truth of this certainty. The individual is, as subject, in the first instance no more than the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion&nbsp;</em>of the Idea of life; its subjective inward process in which it draws on its own resources, and the immediate objectivity which it posits conformably to its Notion as a natural means is mediated by the process that relates itself to the completely posited externality, to the objective totality standing&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifferently&nbsp;</em>alongside it.</p>

First the living being determines itself, in so doing posits itself as denied, and thereby relates itself to an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>to it, to the indifferent objectivity; but secondly, it is equally not lost in this loss of itself but maintains itself therein and remains the identity of the self-similar Notion; thus it is the urge to posit this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other</em>&nbsp;world&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">as its own,&nbsp;</em>as similar to itself, to sublate it and to objectify&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">itself.&nbsp;</em>By doing this, its self-determination has the form of objective externality, and as it is at the same time identical with itself it is absolute&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">contradiction.&nbsp;</em>The immediate shape is the Idea in its simple Notion, objectivity that is conformable to the Notion; as such, it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">good&nbsp;</em>by nature. But since its negative moment realises itself as an objective particularity, that is, since each of the essential moments of its unity is realised as a separate totality, the Notion is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sundered&nbsp;</em>into an absolute disparity with itself; and since, all the same, it is absolute identity in this disharmony, the living being isfor&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">itself&nbsp;</em>this disharmony and has the feeling of this contradiction, which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">pain. Pain&nbsp;</em>is therefore the prerogative of living natures; because they are the existent Notion, they are an actuality of infinite power such that they are within themselves the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negativity</em>&nbsp;of themselves, that this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">their negativity is for them,&nbsp;</em>and that they maintain themselves in their otherness. It is said that contradiction is unthinkable; but the fact is that in the pain of a living being it is even an actual existence.</p>

From pain begin the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">need&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">urge</em>&nbsp;that constitute the transition by which the individual, which is explicitly the negation of itself, becomes also explicitly its own identity &mdash; an identity that exists only as the negation of the former negation. The identity that is in the urge as such is the subjective certainty of itself, in accordance with which it relates itself to its external, indifferently existing world as to an Appearance, to an intrinsically Notionless and unessential actuality. This actuality has to await the subject, which is the immanent end, before it receives the Notion into itself. The indifference of the objective world to the determinateness, and consequently to the end, constitutes its external capability of being conformable to the subject; whatever other specifications it may possess, its mechanical determinability, the absence of the freedom of the immanent Notion, constitutes its impotence to maintain itself against the living being. In so far as the object confronts the living being in the first instance as an indifferent externality, it can act upon it mechanically; but in doing so it is not acting as on a living being; where it enters into relationship with a living being it does not act on it as a cause, but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">excites&nbsp;</em>it. Because the living being is an urge, externality cannot approach or enter it except in so far as it is in its own very nature already&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in the living being;&nbsp;</em>therefore the action on the subject consists merely in the latter finding the externality presented to it&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">conformable.&nbsp;</em>This externality may not be conformable to the subject&#39;s totality, but at least it must correspond to a particular side of it, and this possibility resides simply in the fact that the subject in its external relationship is a particular.</p>

Its particular character, its finitude in general, falls into the more specific manifestation of this relationship. The external element in this is the process of objectivity in general, mechanism and chemism. But this process is immediately broken off and the externality transformed into internality. The external purposiveness that is produced at first by the activity of the subject in the indifferent object is sublated by reason of the fact that the object, relatively to the Notion, is not a substance, and that therefore the Notion cannot become merely the object&#39;s external form, but must posit itself as its essence and immanent pervading determination, in conformity with the Notion&#39;s original identity.</p>

This assimilation accordingly coincides with the individual&#39;s process of reproduction considered above; in this process the individual in the first instance draws upon itself in making its own objectivity its object; the mechanical and chemical conflict of its members with external things is an objective moment of itself. The mechanical and chemical side of the process is a beginning of the dissolution of the living being. Since life is the truth of these processes, and therefore as a living being is the concrete existence of this truth and the power dominating these processes, it takes them within its embrace, pervades them as their universality, and their product is completely determined by it. This conversion of them into the living individuality constitutes the return of this latter into itself, so that production, which as such would be transition into an other, becomes reproduction, in which the living being posits itself as self-identical&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for itself.</em></p>

If external intuition, determined in space and time, is required for objectivity, and it is this that is missing here, then it is quite clear that by objectivity is meant merely sensuous reality; and to have risen above&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">that&nbsp;</em>is a condition of thinking and of truth. But of course, if &#39;I&#39; is taken not in its Notion but as a mere, simple, general idea, in the way we pronounce &#39;I&#39; in everyday consciousness, then it is the abstract determination and not the self-relation that has itself for object. In that case, it is only one of the extremes, a one-sided subject without its objectivity, or else it would be merely an object without subjectivity, were it not for the inconvenience alluded to, that the thinking subject cannot be eliminated from the &#39;I&#39; as object. But in fact the same inconvenience occurs with the former determination, with the &#39;I&#39; as subject; the &#39;I&#39; thinks&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">something,&nbsp;</em>itself or something else. This inseparability of the two forms in which it opposes itself to itself belongs to the innermost nature of its Notion and of the Notion itself; it is precisely what Kant wants to stave off in order to retain the mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">general idea,&nbsp;</em>which does not inwardly differentiate itself and therefore, of course, lacks the Notion. Now a Notionless conception of this kind may indeed oppose itself to the abstract reflective determinations or categories of the previous metaphysics: for in one-sidedness it stands on a level with them, though these are indeed on a higher level of thought; but on the other hand it appears all the more meagre and empty when compared with the profounder ideas of ancient philosophy on the conception of the soul or of thinking, as for example the genuinely speculative ideas of Aristotle. If the Kantian philosophy investigated the reflective categories in question, it was even more bound to investigate the firmly held abstraction of the empty &#39;I&#39;, the presumed idea of the thing-in-itself, which, precisely on account of its abstraction, proves on the contrary to be something completely untrue. The experience of the inconvenience complained of is itself the empirical fact in which the untruth of that abstraction expresses itself.</p>

The proof in question is based on the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simplicity&nbsp;</em>of the soul, by virtue of which it is incapable of alteration,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of transition into an other,&nbsp;</em>in time. Qualitative simplicity is in general the form of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstraction</em>&nbsp;considered above; as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative&nbsp;</em>determinateness it was investigated in the sphere of being, and it was proved that the qualitative, as such abstractly self-related determinateness, is on the contrary for that very reason dialectical, and is merely transition into an other. But in treating of the Notion it was shown that when it is considered in relation to persistence, indestructibility, imperishableness, it is the absolutely true being and the eternal, just because it is not&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract</em>, but&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete</em>simplicity, is determined not as abstractly self-related, but as the unity&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of itself and its other;&nbsp;</em>it cannot therefore pass into that other as though it altered itself in it for the very reason that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other&nbsp;</em>to which it is determined is the Notion itself, so that in this transition it only comes to itself. Now the Kantian criticism opposes to the said&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative&nbsp;</em>determination of the unity of the Notion, the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">quantitative.&nbsp;</em>Although the soul is not a manifold of juxtaposed parts and contains no&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">extensive</em>&nbsp;magnitude, yet we are told consciousness has&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">a degree,&nbsp;</em>and the soul like&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">every concrete existent&nbsp;</em>has an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intensive magnitude;&nbsp;</em>but this postulates the possibility of transition into nothing by a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">gradual passing away.&nbsp;</em>Now what is this refutation but the application to spirit of a category&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of being</em>, of<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intensive magnitude</em>&nbsp;&mdash; a determination that has no truth in itself but on the contrary is sublated in the Notion?</p>

But to cling to phenomena and the mere conceptions given in everyday consciousness is to renounce the Notion and philosophy. Anything rising above this is stigmatised in the Kantian criticism as something high-flown to which reason is in no way entitled. As a matter of fact, the Notion does reach beyond the Notion-less, and the immediate justification for going beyond it is first, the Notion itself, and secondly, from the negative side, the untruth of phenomena and of ordinary thinking, as well as of abstractions like things-in-themselves and the above &#39;I&#39;, that is supposed not to be an object to itself.</p>

We have seen that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">life&nbsp;</em>is the Idea, but at the same time it has shown itself not to be as yet the true representation or mode of the Idea&#39;s existence. For in life, the reality of the Idea exists as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individuality; universality&nbsp;</em>or genus is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inwardness;&nbsp;</em>the truth of life as absolute negative unity is therefore to sublate the abstract &#39; or what is the same, the immediate, individuality, and as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identical,</em>&nbsp;to be self-identical, as genus, to be self-similar.

Conversely, it also begins with the known; this is a tautological proposition; that with which it begins, which therefore it actually cognises, is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ipso facto</em>&nbsp;something known; what is not as yet known and is to be known only later is still an unknown. So far, then, it must be said that cognition, once it has begun, always proceeds from the known to the unknown.</p>

However, this immediacy of the relation is for that reason itself a mediation, for it is the negative relation of the Notion to the object, but a relation that annuls itself, thereby making itself simple and identical. This reflection-into-self is only subjective, because in its mediation the difference is present still only in the form of the presupposed&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">implicit</em>difference, as difference&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of the object</em>&nbsp;within itself. The determination, therefore, brought about by this relation, is the form of simple<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">identity</em>, of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract universality</em>. Accordingly, analytic cognition has in general this identity for its principle; and transition into an other, the connection of different terms, is excluded from itself and from its activity.</p>

Such a material is the principle of discrete magnitude, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one.&nbsp;</em>This relationless atom can be increased to a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plurality,&nbsp;</em>and externally determined and unified into a sum; this process of increasing and delimiting is an empty progression and determining that never gets beyond the same principle of the abstract one. How&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">numbers&nbsp;</em>are further combined and separated depends solely on the positing activity of the cognising subject.&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Magnitude&nbsp;</em>is in general the category within which these determinations are made; it is the determinateness that has become an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">indifferent&nbsp;</em>determinateness, so that the subject matter has no determinateness that might be immanent in it and therefore a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">datum&nbsp;</em>for cognition. Cognition having first provided itself with a contingent variety of numbers, these now constitute the material for further elaboration and manifold relationships. Such relationships, their discovery and elaboration, do not seem, it is true, to be anything immanent in analytic cognition, but something contingent and given; and these relationships and the operations connected with them, too, are usually presented&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">successively as different&nbsp;</em>without any observation of an inner connection. Yet it is easy to discover a guiding principle, and that is the immanent principle of analytic identity, which appears in the diverse as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equality;&nbsp;</em>progress consists in the reduction of the unequal to an ever greater equality. To give an example in the first elements, addition is the combining of quite contingently unequal numbers, multiplication, on the contrary, the combination&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">of equal</em>&nbsp;numbers; these again are followed by the relationship of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the equality of amount and unity,&nbsp;</em>and the relationship of powers makes its appearance.</p>

Kant, it is true, has declared the proposition 5 + 7 = 12, to be a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">synthetic</em>proposition, because the same thing is presented on one side in the form of a plurality, 5 and 7, and on the other side in the form of a unity, 12. But if the analytic proposition is not to mean the completely abstract identity and tautology 12 = 12 and is to contain any advance at all, it must present a difference of some kind, though a difference not based on any quality, on any determinateness of reflection, and still less of the Notion. 5 + 7 and 12 are out and out the same content; the first side also expresses the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">demand that&nbsp;</em>5 and 7 shall be combined in one expression; that is to say, that just as 5 is the result of a counting up in which the counting was quite arbitrarily broken off and could just as well have been continued, so now, in the same way, the counting is to be continued with the condition that the ones to be added shall be seven. The I 2 is therefore a result of 5 and 7 and of an operation which is already posited and in its nature is an act completely external and devoid of any thought, so that it can be performed even by a machine. Here there is not the slightest trace of a transition to an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other;&nbsp;</em>it is a mere continuation, that is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">repetition,&nbsp;</em>of the same operation that produced 5 and 7.</p>

The proof can express nothing but the tautology that the solution is correct because the operation set in the problem has been performed. If the problem is to add several numbers, then the solution is to add them; the proof shows that the solution is correct because the problem was to add, and addition has been carried out. If the problem contains more complex expressions and operations, say for instance, to multiply decimal numbers, and the solution indicates merely the mechanical procedure, a proof does indeed become necessary; but this proof can be nothing else but the analysis of those expressions and of the operation from which the solution proceeds of itself. By this separation of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">solution&nbsp;</em>as a mechanical procedure, and of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proof&nbsp;</em>as a reference back to the nature of the subject matter to be treated, we lose what is precisely the advantage of the analytical problem, namely that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the construction&nbsp;</em>can be immediately deduced from the problem and can therefore be exhibited as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intelligible&nbsp;</em>in and for itself; put the other way, the construction is expressly given a defect peculiar to the synthetic method. In the higher analysis, where with the relationship of powers, we are dealing especially with relationships of discrete magnitude that are qualitative and dependent on Notion determinatenesses, the problems and theorems do of course contain synthetic expressions; there other expressions and relationships must be taken as intermediate terms besides those&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediately specified&nbsp;</em>by the problem or theorem. And, we may add, even these auxiliary terms must be of a kind to be grounded in the consideration and development of some side of the problem or theorem; the synthetic appearance comes solely from the fact that the problem or theorem does not itself already name this side. The problem, for example, of finding the sum of the powers of the roots of an equation is solved by the examination and subsequent connection of the functions which the coefficients of the equation are of the roots.

But definition reduces this wealth of the manifold determinations of intuited existence to the simplest moments; the form of these simple elements, and how they are determined relatively to one another, is contained in the Notion. The subject matter is thus, as we have stated, grasped as a universal that is at the same time essentially determinate. The subject matter itself is the third factor, the individual, in which the genus and the particularisation are posited in one; it is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>that is posited&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">outside&nbsp;</em>the Notion, since the latter is not yet self-determining.</p>

But the reflection of the Notion-moments into themselves, which is individuality, is not yet contained in this reality, and therefore the object, in so far as it is in cognition, is not yet determined as subjective. Whereas, cognition on the contrary is subjective and has an external starting point, or it is subjective by reason of its external starting point in the individual. The content of the Notion is therefore a<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">datum&nbsp;</em>and contingent. Consequently, the concrete Notion itself is contingent in a twofold aspect: first it is contingent in respect of its content as such; secondly it is contingent which determinations of the content from among the manifold qualities that the object possesses in external existence are to be selected for the Notion and are to constitute its moments.</p>

For since individuality, which is determined in and for itself, lies outside the Notion-determination peculiar to synthetic cognition there is no principle available for determining which sides of the subject matter are to be regarded as belonging to its Notion-determination and which merely to the external reality. This constitutes a difficulty in the case of definitions, a difficulty that for synthetic cognition cannot be overcome. Yet here a distinction must be made. In the first place, the definition of products of self-conscious purposiveness is easily discovered; for the end that they are to serve is a determination created out of the subjective resolve and constituting the essential particularisation, the form of the concrete existent thing, which is here the sole concern. Apart from this, the nature of its material and its other external properties, in so far as they correspond to the end, are contained in its determination; the rest are unessential for it.</p>

These objects therefore are only what they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">meant&nbsp;</em>to be; their Notion determination in general, and more precisely the specific difference, possesses in them its simple unhindered reality. To this extent, they resemble the products of external purposiveness, and they also agree with the subject matter of arithmetic in which likewise the underlying determination is only that which has been posited in it. True, space has still further determinations: its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">three-dimensionality,&nbsp;</em>its continuity and divisibility, which are not first posited in it by external determination. But these belong to the accepted material and are immediate presuppositions; it is only the combination and entanglement of the former subjective determinations with this peculiar nature of the domain into which they have been imported that produces synthetic relationships and laws. In the case of numerical determinations, since they are based on the simple principle of the One, their combination and any further determination is simply and solely a positedness; on the other hand, determinations in space, which is explicitly a continuous&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mutual externality,&nbsp;</em>run a further course of their own and possess a reality distinct from their Notion; but this no longer belongs to the immediate definition.</p>

In general such objects are, for representation,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">things of many properties.&nbsp;</em>Here, what we have to do in the first instance is to apprehend what is their proximate genus, and then, what is their specific difference. We have therefore to determine which of the many properties belong to the object as genus, and which as species, and further which among these properties is the essential one; this last point involves the necessity of ascertaining their interrelationship, whether one is already posited with the other. But for this purpose there is so far no other criterion to hand than&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">existence&nbsp;</em>itself. The essentiality of the property for the purpose of the definition, in which it is to be posited as a simple, undeveloped determinateness, is its universality. But in existence universality is merely empirical. It may be universality in time - whether the property in question is lasting, while the others show themselves transitory in the subsistence of the whole; or it may be a universality resulting from comparison with other concrete wholes and in that case it goes no further than community. Now if comparison indicates as the common basis the total&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">habitue&nbsp;</em>as empirically presented, reflection has to bring this together into a simple thought determination and to grasp the simple character of such a totality. But the only possible attestation that a thought determination, or a single one of the immediate properties, constitutes the simple and specific essence of the object, is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">derivation&nbsp;</em>of such a determination from the concrete properties of the subject matter. But this would demand an analysis transforming the immediate properties into thoughts and reducing what is concrete to something simple. Such an analysis, however, would be higher than the one already considered; for it could not be abstractive, but would have to preserve in the universal what is specific in the concrete, unify it and show it to be dependent on the simple thought determination.</p>

But definition is the first, still undeveloped Notion; therefore, when it has to apprehend the simple determinateness of the subject matter, which apprehension has to be something immediate, it can only employ for the purpose one of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">its immediate&nbsp;</em>so-called properties - a determination of sensuous existence or representation. The isolation, then, of this property by abstraction, constitutes simplicity, and for universality and essentiality the Notion has to fall back onto empirical universality, the persistence in altered circumstances, and the reflection that seeks the Notion-determination in external existence and in picture thinking, that is, seeks it where it is not to be found. Definition, therefore, automatically renounces the Notion-determinations proper, which would be essentially principles of the subject matter, and contents itself with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">marks,&nbsp;</em>that is, determinations in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">which essentiality&nbsp;</em>for the object itself is a matter of indifference, and which are intended merely to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">distinguishing&nbsp;</em>marks for an external reflection. A single, external determinateness of this kind is too inadequate to the concrete totality and to the nature of its Notion, to justify its selection for its own sake, nor could it be taken for the true expression and determination of a concrete whole. According to Blumenbach&#39;s observation, for example, the lobe of the ear is absent in all other animals, and therefore in the usual phraseology of common and distinguishing marks it could quite properly be used as the distinctive characteristic in the definition of physical man. But how inadequate such a completely external determination at once appears when compared with the conception of the total&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">habitue&nbsp;</em>of physical man, and with the demand that the Notion determination shall be something essential! It is quite contingent whether the marks adopted in the definition are pure makeshifts like this, or on the other hand approximate more to the nature of a principle. It is also to be observed that, on account of their externality, they have not been the starting point in the cognition of the Notion of the object; on the contrary, an obscure feeling, an indefinite but deeper sense, an inkling of what is essential, has preceded the discovery of the genera in nature and in spirit, and only afterwards has a specific externality been sought to satisfy the understanding. In existence the Notion has entered into externality and is accordingly explicated into its differences and cannot be attached simply to a single one of such properties. The properties, as the externality of the thing, are external to themselves; that is why, as we pointed out in the sphere of Appearance when dealing with the thing of many properties, properties essentially become even self-subsistent matters; spirit, regarded from the same standpoint of Appearance, becomes an aggregate of a number of self-subsistent forces. Through this standpoint, the single property or force, even where it is posited as indifferent to the others, ceases to be a characterising principle, with the result that the determinateness, as determinateness of the Notion, vanishes altogether.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;">Into concrete things, along with the diversity of the properties among themselves, there enters also the difference between the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Notion</em>and its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actualisation.&nbsp;</em>The Notion in nature and in spirit has an external presentation in which its determinateness shows itself as dependence on the external, as transitoriness and inadequacy. Therefore, although any actual thing no doubt shows in itself what it<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ought&nbsp;</em>to be, yet in accordance with the negative judgment of the Notion it may equally show that its actuality only imperfectly corresponds to this Notion, that it is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">bad.&nbsp;</em>Now the definition is supposed to indicate the determinateness of the Notion in an immediate property; yet there is no property against which an instance cannot be brought in which the total habitus, though it enables one to discern the concrete thing to be defined, yet the property taken as its characteristic shows itself immature or stunted. In a bad plant, a poor specimen of an animal, a contemptible human being, a bad state, aspects of its concrete existence are defective or entirely obliterated that otherwise might have been adopted for the definition as the distinguishing mark and essential determinateness in the existence of such a concrete. But for all that, a bad plant or a bad animal, etc., still remains a plant or an animal. If, therefore, bad specimens too are to be covered by the definition, then all the properties that we wanted to regard as essential elude us through instances of malformations in which those properties are lacking. Thus for example the essentiality of the brain for physical man is contradicted by the instance of acephalous individuals, the essentiality of the protection of life and property for the state, by the instance of despotic states and tyrannous governments. If the Notion is asserted against such an instance and the instance, being measured by the Notion, is declared to be a bad specimen, then the Notion is no longer attested by phenomena. But the self-subsistence of the Notion is contrary to the meaning of definition; for definition is supposed to be the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>Notion, and therefore can only draw on the immediacy of existence for its determinations for objects, and can justify itself only in what it finds already to hand. Whether its content is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-and-for itself&nbsp;</em>truth or a contingency, this lies outside its sphere; but formal truth, the agreement between the Notion subjectively posited in the definition and an actual object outside it, cannot be established because the individual object may also be a bad specimen.</p>

Or, in other words, the determinateness of the content contained in the definition, because it is determinateness, is not merely an immediate, but is mediated by its opposite; consequently definition can apprehend its subject matter only through the opposite determination and must therefore pass over into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">division.</em></p>

But since definition itself already begins with the particular, its necessity for passing over into division lies in the particular, that by itself points to another particular. Conversely, it is precisely in the act of holding fast to the determinateness in the need to distinguish it from its other, that the particular separates itself off from the universal; consequently the universal is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presupposed</em>&nbsp;for division. The procedure is, therefore, that the individual content of cognition ascends through particularity to the extreme of universality; but now the latter must be regarded as the objective basis, and with this as the starting point, division presents itself as disjunction of the universal as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">prius</em>.<a name="HL3_801"></a></p>

But the fact that the aim is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">to cognise</em>, implies that the question of a comparison with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">intuition</em>&nbsp;is already settled and done with; there can only be a question of what is to be the first and what is to be the nature of the sequel&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">within the process of cognition</em>; it is no longer a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">natural</em>&nbsp;method, but a method appropriate to<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">cognition</em>&nbsp;that is demanded. If it is merely a question of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">easiness</em>, then it is self-evident besides, that it is easier for cognition to grasp the abstract simple thought determination than the concrete subject matter, which is a manifold connection of such thought determinations and their relationships; and it is in this manner that we have now to apprehend the concrete, and not as it is in intuition. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal</em>&nbsp;is in and for itself the first moment of the Notion because it is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple</em>&nbsp;moment, and the particular is only subsequent to it because it is the mediated moment; and conversely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple</em>&nbsp;is the more universal, and the concrete, as in itself differentiated and so mediated, is that which already presupposes the transition from a first. This remark applies not only to the order of procedure in the specific forms of definitions, divisions, and propositions, but also to the order of cognition as a whole and simply with respect to the difference of abstract and concrete in general. Hence in learning to read, for example, the rational way is not to begin with reading of whole words or even syllables, but with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">elements</em>&nbsp;of the words and syllables, and the signs of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract</em>&nbsp;sounds: in written characters, the analysis of the concrete word into its abstract sounds and their signs is already accomplished; for this very reason, the process of learning to read is a primary occupation with abstract objects. In&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">geometry</em>, a beginning has to be made not with a concrete spatial figure but with the point and the line, and then plane figures, and among the latter not with polygons, but with the triangle, and among curves, with the circle.</p>

Magnetism, electricity, the various gases, and so forth, are objects the specific character of which is ascertained by cognition only by apprehending them in isolation from the concrete conditions in which they appear in the actual world, Experiment, it is true, presents them to intuition in a concrete case; but for one thing experiment must, in order to be scientific, take only the conditions necessary for the purpose; and for another, it must multiply itself in order to show that the inseparable concretisation of these conditions is unessential, and this it does by exhibiting the things in another concrete shape and again in another, so that for cognition nothing remains but their abstract form.</p>

But for cognition, the universal and therefore truly primary form is the middle one of the above-named, in which colour hovers between subjectivity and objectivity as the familiar spectrum, completely unentangled as yet with subjective and objective circumstances. The latter above all merely disturb the pure consideration of the nature of this subject matter because they behave as active causes and therefore make it uncertain whether the specific alterations, transitions, and relationships of colour are founded in its own specific nature, or are rather to be attributed to the pathological specific constitution of those circumstances, to the healthy and the morbid particular affections and effects of the organs of the subject, or to the chemical, vegetable, and animal forces of the objects. Numerous other examples might be adduced from the cognition of organic nature and of the world of spirit; everywhere the abstract must constitute the starting point and the element in which and from which spread the particularities and rich formations of the concrete.</p>

Hence there is for it a higher universal, and for this again a higher, and so on, in the first instance, to infinity. For the cognition here considered there is no immanent limit, since it starts from the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">given,&nbsp;</em>and the form of abstract universality is characteristic of its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">prius</em>. Therefore any subject matter whatever that seems to possess an elementary universality is made the subject matter of a specific science, and is an absolute beginning to the extent that&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ordinary thought is presupposed&nbsp;</em>to be acquainted with it and it is taken on its own account as requiring no derivation. Definition takes it as immediate.</p>

For this progress, only an immanent principle would be required, that is, a beginning from the universal and the Notion; but the cognition here considered lacks such a principle, for it only pursues the form determination of the Notion without its reflection-into-self, and therefore takes the determinateness of the content from what is given. For the particular that makes its appearance in division, there is no ground of its own available, either in regard to what is to constitute the basis of the division, or in regard to the specific relationship that the members of the disjunction are to have to one another. Consequently in this respect the business of cognition can only consist, partly, in setting in order the particular elements discovered in the empirical material, and partly, in finding the universal determinations of that particularity by comparison. These determinations are then accepted as grounds of division, and there may be a multiplicity of such grounds, as also a similar multiplicity of divisions based on them. The relationship between the members, the species, of a division, has only this general determination, that they are determined relatively to one another&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in accordance with the assumed ground of division;&nbsp;</em>if their difference rested on a different consideration, they would not be coordinated on the same level with one another.</p>

Thus we see it laid down as a rule that division shall&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">exhaust&nbsp;</em>the notion; but as a matter of fact each individual member of the division must exhaust&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the notion.&nbsp;</em>It is, however, really the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>of the notion that one means should be exhausted; but with the empirical multiplicity of species devoid of any immanent determination, it contributes nothing to the exhaustion of the notion whether more or fewer are found to exist; whether, for example, in addition to the sixty-seven species of parrots another dozen are found is for the exhaustion of the genus a matter of indifference. The demand for exhaustion can only mean the tautological proposition that all the species shall be presented in their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">completeness.&nbsp;</em>Now with the extension of empirical knowledge it may very well happen that species are found which do not fit in with the adopted definition of the genus; for frequently the definition is adopted more on the basis of a vague conception of the entire&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">habitus</em>, rather than in accordance with a more or less individual mark that is expressly meant to serve for its definition. In such a case the genus would have to be modified and a justification would have to be found for regarding some other number of species as species of a new genus; in other words, the genus would be defined by what we group together in accordance with some principle or other that we choose to adopt as unity; and in this case the principle itself would be the basis of division. Conversely, if we hold to the determinateness originally adopted as characteristic of the genus, that material which we wished to group, as species, in a unity with the earlier species would be excluded. This unsystematic procedure, which sometimes adopts a determinateness as essential moment of the genus and then either subordinates the particulars to it or excludes them from it, and sometimes starts with the particular and in grouping it lets itself again be guided by some other determinateness, gives the appearance of the play of a caprice to which it is left to decide which part or which side of the concrete it will fix on and use as its principle of arrangement. Physical nature presents of itself such a contingency in the principles of division. By reason of its dependent external actuality it stands in a complex connectedness that for it likewise is given; accordingly there exists a crowd of principles to which it has to conform, and therefore in one series of its forms follows one principle, and in other series other principles, as well as producing hybrids that belong at the same time to different sides of the division. Thus it happens that in one series of natural objects marks stand out as very characteristic and essential that in others become inconspicuous and purposeless, so that it becomes impossible to adhere to a principle of division of this kind.</p>

For example, in the case of animals, the instruments of eating, the teeth and claws, are employed in systems of classification as a broad radical ground of division; they are taken, in the first instance, merely as aspects in which the distinguishing marks for the subjective purposes of cognition can be more easily indicated. But as a matter of fact these organs do not merely imply a differentiation belonging to external reflection, but they are the vital point of animal individuality where it posits itself as a self-related individuality distinct from its other, from the nature that is external to it, and as an individuality that withdraws itself from continuity with the other. In the case of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">plant,&nbsp;</em>the fertilising organs constitute the highest point of vegetable life, by which the plant points to the transition into sex difference, and thereby into individual individuality. The system of botany has therefore rightly turned to this point for a principle of division that, if not adequate is far-reaching, and has thereby taken as its basis a determinateness that is not merely a determinateness for external reflection for purposes of comparison, but is in and for itself the highest of which the plant is capable.</p>

Definition contains only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">one determinateness,&nbsp;</em>division contains determinateness in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">relation to others;&nbsp;</em>in individualisation the object has gone asunder within itself. Whereas definition stops short at the general concept, in theorems, on the contrary, the object is cognised in its reality, in the conditions and forms of its real existence. Hence, in conjunction with definition, it represents the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">Idea,&nbsp;</em>which is the unity of the Notion and reality. But the cognition here under consideration, which is still occupied in seeking, does not attain to this presentation in so far as the reality it deals with does not proceed from the Notion, and therefore the dependence of reality on the Notion and consequently the unity itself is not cognised.</p>

The synthetic element in definition and division is an externally adopted connection; what is found given is brought into the form of the Notion, but, as given, the entire content is merely&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presented</em>&nbsp;[<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">monstriert</em>], whereas the theorem has to be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">demonstrated.&nbsp;</em>As this cognition&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">does not deduce&nbsp;</em>the content of its definitions and the principles of its divisions, it seems as if it might spare itself the trouble of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proving&nbsp;</em>the relationships expressed by theorems and content itself in this respect, too, with observation. But what distinguishes cognition from mere observation and representation is the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form of the Notion&nbsp;</em>as such that cognition imparts to the content; this is achieved in definition and division: but as the content of the theorem comes from the Notion&#39;s moment of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individuality,&nbsp;</em>it consists in determinations of reality that no longer have for their relationship the simple and immediate determinations of the Notion; in individuality the Notion has passed over into&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">otherness,</em>into the reality whereby it becomes Idea. Thus the synthesis contained in the theorem no longer has the form of the Notion for its justification; it is a connection of [merely]&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">diverse&nbsp;</em>terms. Consequently the unity not yet posited with it has still to be demonstrated, and therefore proof becomes necessary even to this cognition.</p>

But the content of definition is in general a determinate one, and therefore is itself essentially a mediated content; it has only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">subjective&nbsp;</em>immediacy, that is, the subject makes an arbitrary beginning and accepts a subject matter as presupposition. Now since this subject-matter is in general concrete within itself and must also be divided, the result is a number of determinations that are by their nature mediated, and are accepted not on the basis of any principle, but merely subjectively as immediate and unproved. Even in Euclid, who has always been justly recognised as the master in this synthetic kind of cognition, we find under the name of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">axiom a presupposition</em>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">parallel lines&nbsp;</em>which has been thought to stand in need of proof, and various attempts to supply this want have been made. In several other theorems, people have thought that they had discovered presuppositions which should not have been immediately assumed but ought to have been proved. As regards the axiom concerning parallel lines, it may be remarked that it is precisely there that we may discern the sound sense of Euclid, who had appreciated exactly the element as well as the nature of his science. The proof of the said axiom would have had to be derived from the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">notion&nbsp;</em>of parallel lines; but a proof of that kind is no more part of his science than is the deduction of his definitions, axioms and in general his subject matter, space itself and its immediate determinations, the three dimensions. Such a deduction can only be drawn from the Notion, and this lies outside the peculiar domain of Euclid&#39;s science; these are therefore necessarily&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presuppositions&nbsp;</em>for it, relative firsts.</p>

They are commonly but incorrectly taken as absolute firsts, as though in and for themselves they required no proof. Were this in fact the case, they would be mere tautologies, as it is only in abstract identity that no difference is present, and therefore no mediation required. If, however, axioms are more than tautologies, they are&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">propositions&nbsp;</em>from some&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other science,</em>&nbsp;since for the science they serve as axioms they are meant to be presuppositions. Hence they are, strictly speaking,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">theorems,</em>&nbsp;and theorems taken mostly from logic. The axioms of geometry are lemmata of this kind, logical propositions, which moreover approximate to tautologies because they are only concerned with magnitude and therefore qualitative differences are extinguished in them; the chief axiom, the purely quantitative syllogism, has been discussed above. Axioms, therefore, considered in and for themselves, require proof as much as definitions and divisions, and the only reason they are not made into theorems is that, as relatively first for a certain standpoint, they are assumed as presuppositions.</p>

It is a very superficial view that assigns equal importance to all the propositions on the ground that in general each contains a truth and is equally essential in the formal progress, in the context, of the proof. The difference in respect of the content of theorems is most intimately connected with this progress itself; some further remarks on the latter will serve to elucidate in more detail this difference as well as the nature of synthetic cognition. To begin with, Euclidean geometry - which as representative of the synthetic method, of which it furnishes the most perfect specimen, shall serve us as example - has always been extolled for the ordered arrangement in the sequence of the theorems, by which for each theorem the propositions requisite for its construction and proof are always found already proved. This circumstance concerns formal consecutiveness; yet, important as it is, it is still rather a matter of an external arrangement for the purpose of the matter in hand and has on its own account no relation to the essential difference of Notion and Idea in which lies a higher principle of the necessity of the progress. That is to say, the definitions with which we begin, apprehend the sensuous object as immediately given and determine it according to its proximate genus and specific difference; these are likewise the simple,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate&nbsp;</em>determinatenesses of the Notion, universality and particularity, whose relationship is no further developed. Now the initial theorems themselves can only make use of immediate determinations such as are contained in the definitions; similarly their reciprocal&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">dependence,&nbsp;</em>in the first instance, can only relate to this general point, that one is simply&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determined&nbsp;</em>by the other. Thus Euclid&#39;s first propositions about triangles deal only with&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">congruence,&nbsp;</em>that is,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">how many&nbsp;</em>parts in a triangle&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">must be determined,&nbsp;</em>in order that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">remaining&nbsp;</em>parts of one and the same triangle, or the whole of it, shall be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">altogether determined.&nbsp;</em>The comparison of two triangles with one another, and the basing of congruence on&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">coincidence&nbsp;</em>is a detour necessary to a method that is forced to employ&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sensuous coincidence&nbsp;</em>instead of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thought,&nbsp;</em>namely, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness&nbsp;</em>of the triangles.</p>

That is to say, whatever completely determines a triangle, for example two sides and the included angle, is already the whole triangle for the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">understanding;&nbsp;</em>nothing further is required for its complete determinateness; the remaining two angles and the third side are the superfluity of reality over the determinateness of the Notion. Accordingly what these theorems really do is to reduce the sensuous triangle, which of course requires three sides and three angles, to its simplest conditions. The definition had mentioned only the three lines in general that enclose the plane figure and make it a triangle; it is a theorem that first expresses the fact that the angle is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determined&nbsp;</em>by the determination of the sides, just as the remaining theorems contain dependence of three other parts on three others. But the complete immanent determinateness of the magnitude of a triangle in terms of its sides is contained in the theorem of Pythagoras; here we have first the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equation&nbsp;</em>of the sides of the triangle, for in the preceding propositions the sides are in general only brought into a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reciprocal determinateness&nbsp;</em>of the parts of the triangle, not into an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equation.&nbsp;</em>This proposition is therefore the perfect,&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">real definition</em>&nbsp;of the triangle, that is, of the right-angled triangle in the first instance, the triangle that is simplest in its differences and therefore the most regular. Euclid closes the first book with this proposition, for in it a perfect determinateness is achieved. So, too, in the second book, after reducing to the uniform type those triangles which are not right-angles and are affected with greater inequality, he concludes with the reduction of the rectangle to the square - with an equation between the self-equal, or the square, and that which is in its own self unequal, or the rectangle; similarly in the theorem of Pythagoras, the hypotenuse, which corresponds to the right-angle, to the self-equal, constitutes one side of the equation, while the other is constituted by the self-unequal, the two remaining sides. The above equation between the square and the rectangle is the basis of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">second&nbsp;</em>definition of the circle - which again is the theorem of Pythagoras, except that here the two sides forming the right-angle are taken as variable magnitudes. The first equation of the circle is in precisely that relationship of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sensuous&nbsp;</em>determinateness to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equation&nbsp;</em>that holds between the two different definitions of conic sections in general.</p>

The shining example of the synthetic method is the science of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">geometry</em>&nbsp;- but it has been inaptly applied to other sciences as well, even to philosophy. Geometry is a science of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">magnitude,&nbsp;</em>and therefore formal reasoning is most appropriate to it; it treats of the merely quantitative determination and abstracts from the qualitative, and can therefore confine itself to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">formal identity,&nbsp;</em>to the unity that lacks the Notion, which is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equality&nbsp;</em>and which belongs to the external abstractive reflection. Its subject matter, the determinations of space, are already such abstract subject matter, prepared for the purpose of having a completely finite external determinateness. This science, on account of its abstract subject matter, on the one hand, has this element of the sublime about it, that in these empty silent spaces colour is blotted out and the other sensuous properties have vanished, and further, that in it every other interest that appeals more intimately to the living individuality is silenced. On the other hand, the abstract subject matter is still space, a non-sensuous sensuous; intuition is raised into its abstraction; space is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form&nbsp;</em>of intuition, but is still intuition, and so sensuous, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">asunderness&nbsp;</em>of sensuousness itself, its pure&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">absence of Notion.&nbsp;</em>We have heard enough talk lately about the excellence of geometry from this aspect; the fact that it is based on sensuous intuition has been declared its supreme excellence and people have even imagined that this is the ground of its highly scientific character, and that its proofs rest on intuition. This shallow view must be countered by the plain reminder that no science is brought about by intuition, but only by&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thinking</em>. The intuitive character of geometry that derives from its still sensuous material only gives it that evidential side that the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sensuous&nbsp;</em>as such possesses for unthinking spirit. It is therefore lamentable that this sensuousness of its material has been accounted an advantage, whereas it really indicates the inferiority of its standpoint. It is solely to the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstraction&nbsp;</em>of its sensuous subject matter that it owes its capability of attaining a higher scientific character; and it is to this abstraction that it owes its great superiority over those collections of information that people are also pleased to call sciences, which have for their content the concrete perceptible material of sense, and only indicate by the order which they seek to introduce into it a remote inkling and hint of the requirements of the Notion.</p>

The science of these determinations is, accordingly, a simple science of the finite that is compared in respect of magnitude and whose unity is the external unity of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">equality.&nbsp;</em>But at the same time the delineation of these figures starts from various aspects and principles and the various figures arise independently; accordingly, the comparison of them makes apparent also their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">qualitative&nbsp;</em>unlikeness and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">incommensurability.&nbsp;</em>This development impels geometry beyond the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">finitude</em>&nbsp;in which it was advancing so methodically and surely to&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">infinity&nbsp;</em>to the positing of things as equal that are qualitatively different. Here it loses the evidential side that it possessed in its other aspect, where it is based on a stable finitude and is untouched by the Notion and its manifestation, the transition just mentioned. At this point the finite science has reached its limit; for the necessity and mediation of the synthetic method is no longer grounded merely in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">positive&nbsp;</em>but in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negative identity.</em></p>

In regard to definition and division we have already ascertained the relevant facts, and here only theorem and proof should remain to be discussed.

This position is especially noteworthy in the case of the empirical sciences such as physics, for example, when they want to give themselves the form of synthetic sciences. The method is then as follows. The&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">reflective determinations&nbsp;</em>of particular&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">forces&nbsp;</em>or other inner and essence-like forms which result from the method of analysing experience and can be justified only as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">results,&nbsp;</em>must be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">placed in the forefront&nbsp;</em>in order that they may provide a general&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">foundation&nbsp;</em>that is subsequently&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">applied to the individual&nbsp;</em>and demonstrated in it.

In this subordination of concrete experience to presupposed determinations, the foundation of the theory is obscured and is exhibited only from the side that is conformable to the theory;&nbsp;</span>and in general the unprejudiced examination of concrete observations on their own is made more difficult. Only by turning the entire process upside down does the whole thing get its right relationship in which the connection of grounds and consequent, and the correctness of the transformation of perception into thought can be surveyed.

The contrast between a material of this kind, easily grasped and by its nature incapable of any rigorous and scientific treatment, and the stiff circumlocutory language of science in which it is clothed, has of itself demonstrated the clumsiness of such application and discredited it.</p>

From this course the method has emerged as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">self-knowing Notion that has itself</em>, as the absolute, both subjective and objective, for its subject matter, consequently as the pure correspondence of the Notion and its reality, as a concrete that is the Notion itself.</p>

But first of all it is not an immediate of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">sensuous intuition</em>&nbsp;or of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">representation</em>, but of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thinking</em>, which on account of its immediacy may also be called a supersensuous&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">inner intuition</em>.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin-left: 18.21875px; margin-right: 18.21875px; text-align: justify;"><a name="HL3_828"></a>The immediate of sensuous intuition is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">manifold</em>&nbsp;and an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">individual</em>. But cognition is thinking by means of notions, and therefore its beginning also is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">only in the element of thought</em>&nbsp;&mdash; it is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple</em>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universal</em>. This form has already been discussed under definition. At the beginning of finite cognition universality is likewise recognised as an essential determination, but it is taken as a determination of thought and of Notion only in opposition to being. In point of fact this&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">first</em>&nbsp;universality is an&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate</em>&nbsp;one, and for that reason has equally the significance of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being</em>; for being is precisely this abstract relation-to-self. Being requires no further derivation, as though it belonged to the abstract product of definition only because it is taken from sensuous intuition or elsewhere, and in so far as it is pointed out to us. This pointing out and derivation is a matter of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">mediation</em>, which is more than a mere beginning, and is a mediation of a kind that does not belong to a comprehension by means of thinking, but is the elevation of ordinary thinking, of the empirical and ratiocinative consciousness, to the standpoint of thought. According to the current opposition of thought or concept and being it is regarded as an important truth that no being belongs as yet to the former, taken on its own, and that the latter has a ground of its own that is independent of thought. But the simple determination of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being</em>&nbsp;is in itself so meagre that, if only for that reason, there is no need to make much fuss about it; the universal is immediately itself this immediate, since as abstract it also is merely the abstract relation-to-self, which is being. As a matter of fact, the demand that being should be exhibited for us to see has a further, inner meaning involving more than this abstract determination; what is meant by it is in general the demand for the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">realisation of the Notion</em>, which realisation does not lie in the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">beginning</em>&nbsp;itself, but is rather the goal and the task of the entire further development of cognition. Further, since the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content</em>&nbsp;of the beginning is supposed to be justified and authenticated as something true or correct by its being pointed out in inner or outer perception, it is no longer the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form</em>&nbsp;of universality as such that is meant, but its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness</em>, of which we shall need to speak presently. The authentication of the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate content</em>&nbsp;with which the beginning is made seems to lie&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">behind</em>&nbsp;it; but in fact it is to be considered as an advance, that is, if it belongs to philosophical cognition.</p>

Universality is the pure simple Notion, and the method, as consciousness of the Notion, knows that universality is only a moment and that in it the Notion is not yet determined in and for itself. But with this consciousness that would carry the beginning further only for the sake of the method, the method would be a formal affair, something posited in external reflection. Since however it is the objective immanent form, the immediate of the beginning must be&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in its own self deficient</em>&nbsp;and endowed with the urge to carry itself further. But in the absolute method the universal has the value not of a mere abstraction but of the objective universal, that is, the universal that is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">concrete totality</em>, though that totality is not yet<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited</em>, is not yet&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for itself</em>. Even the abstract universal as such, considered in its Notion, that is in its truth, is not merely the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">simple</em>, but as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">abstract</em>&nbsp;is already&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">posited</em>&nbsp;as infected with a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">negation</em>. For this reason too&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">there is</em>&nbsp;nothing, whether in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">actuality</em>&nbsp;or in&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">thought</em>, that is as simple and as abstract as is commonly imagined. A simple thing of this kind is a mere&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">presumption</em>&nbsp;that has its ground solely in the unconsciousness of what is actually present. Above, that with which the beginning is made was determined as the immediate; the<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediacy of the universal</em>&nbsp;is the same thing that is here expressed as the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself&nbsp;</em>that is without a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being-for-self</em>. Hence it may indeed be said that every beginning must be made&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">with the absolute</em>, just as all advance is merely the exposition of it, in so far as its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself</em>&nbsp;is the Notion. But because the absolute is at first only&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>&nbsp;it equally is&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">not</em>&nbsp;the absolute nor the posited Notion, and also not the Idea; for what characterises these is precisely the fact that in them the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in-itself</em>&nbsp;is only an abstract, one-sided moment. Hence the advance is not a kind of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">superfluity</em>; this it would be if that with which the beginning is made were in truth already the absolute; the advance consists rather in the universal determining itself and being&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">for itself</em>&nbsp;the universal, that is, equally an individual and a subject. Only in its consummation is it the absolute.</p>

This kind of external and fixed subject of imagination and understanding and these abstract determinations, far from meriting the status of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">ultimates</em>, of secure and permanent substrates, are rather to be regarded as themselves immediate, as just that kind of presupposed and initial immediate that, as was shown above, must in its own essential nature&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">[in and for itself]</em>&nbsp;submit to dialectic, because it is to be taken as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">in itself</em>&nbsp;the Notion.</p>

The difference is concerned solely with the relationship of the foundation as such; true, it is now likewise a foundation, but its immediacy is only a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form</em>, since it was a result as well; hence its determinateness as content is no longer something merely picked up, but something&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">deduced</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">proved</em>.</p>

The method itself by means of this moment expands itself into a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">system</em>. At first the beginning had to be, for the method, wholly indeterminate in respect of content; to this extent it appears as the merely formal soul, for and by which the beginning was determined simply and solely in regard to its&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form</em>, namely, as the immediate and the universal. Through the movement we have indicated, the subject matter has obtained for itself a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness</em>&nbsp;that is a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content</em>, because the negativity that has withdrawn into simplicity is the sublated form, and as simple determinateness stands over against its development, and first of all over against its very opposition to universality.</p>

This can be expressed as the now specific demand that the beginning, since it is itself a determinate relatively to the determinateness of the result, shall be taken not as an immediate but as something mediated and deduced.&nbsp;<a name="HL3_839a"></a><span class="vil" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 34); background: rgb(255, 255, 221);">This may appear as the demand for an infinite retrogression in proof and deduction</span>; just as from the fresh beginning that has been obtained, a result likewise emerges from the method in its course, so that the advance equally rolls<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">onwards</em>&nbsp;to infinity.</p>

At first sight, even such beginnings as&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being, essence, universality</em>, seem to be of such a kind as to possess the complete universality and absence of content demanded for a wholly formal beginning, as it is supposed to be, and therefore, as absolutely first beginnings, demand and admit of no further regress. As they are pure relations to self, immediate and indeterminate, they do not of course possess within themselves the difference which in any other kind of beginning, is directly posited between the universality of its form and its content. But it is the very indeterminateness which the above logical beginnings have for their sole content that constitutes their determinateness; this consists, namely, in their negativity as sublated mediation; the particularity of this gives even their indeterminateness a particularity by which&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">being, essence,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">universality</em>&nbsp;are distinguished from one another. The determinateness then which belongs to them if they are taken by themselves is their&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">immediate determinateness</em>, just as much as the determinateness of any other kind of content, and therefore requires a deduction; for the method it is a matter of indifference whether the determinateness be taken as determinateness of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">form</em>&nbsp;or of&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content</em>. That a content has been determined by the first of its results is not in fact for the method, the beginning of a new mode; the method remains neither more nor less formal than before. For since it is the absolute form, the Notion that knows itself and everything as Notion, there is no content that could stand over against it and determine it to be a one-sided external form.</p>

From one aspect, the&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinateness</em>which the method creates for itself in its result is the moment by means of which the method is self-mediation and converts&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">the immediate beginning into something mediated</em>. But conversely, it is through the determinateness that this mediation of the method runs its course; it returns&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">through</em>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">content</em>&nbsp;as through an apparent&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">other</em>&nbsp;of itself to its beginning in such a manner that not only does it restore that beginning &mdash; as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">determinate</em>&nbsp;beginning however &mdash; but the result is no less the sublated determinateness, and so too the restoration of the first immediacy in which it began. This it accomplishes as a&nbsp;<em style="word-spacing: 0.2em;">system of totality</em>. We have still to consider it in this determination.</p>

For the result contains its beginning and its course has enriched it by a fresh determinateness. The universal constitutes the foundation; the advance is therefore not to be taken as a flowing from one other to the next other. In the absolute method the Notion maintains itself in its otherness. the universal in its particularisation, in judgment and reality; at each stage of its further determination it raises the entire mass of its preceding content, and by its dialectical advance it not only does not lose anything or leave anything behind, but carries along with it all it has gained, and inwardly enriches and consolidates itself.</span>&nbsp;</p>

They have an untrue content, for they convert what we know to be finite and untrue into something incontestable and absolute, namely, a limited cognition determined as form and instrument relatively to its content; this untrue cognition is itself also the form, the process of seeking grounds, that is retrogressive..
